  <h2 class='c008'>THE PROGRESS OF DISCOVERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>II THE ROUTES OF PINEDA, NARVAEZ, AND DE SOTO AND MOSCOSO</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In 1519 Alonso Alvarez de Pineda (or Pinedo) was sent as commander
of an expedition of three or four sailing vessels to explore
the coast of Florida and the northern half of the Gulf of Mexico,
under a commission from Garay, the governor of the Spanish settlements
in Jamaica. The resulting map, transmitted by Garay to Spain, gives a
somewhat correctly proportioned outline of the entire gulf, with Florida,
Cuba, and Yucatan inclosing it on the east; and the Mississippi is named
Rio del Espiritu Santo (River of the Holy Spirit). In Harrisse’s
<cite>Discovery of North America</cite> (1892, p. 168), a translation from the contemporary
Spanish account of this expedition says, concerning the Mississippi,
that the ships “entered a river which was found to be very large and
very deep, at the mouth of which they say they found an extensive town,
where they remained forty days and careened their vessels. The natives
treated our men in a friendly manner, trading with them, and giving what
they possessed. The Spaniards ascended a distance of six leagues up the
river, and saw on its banks, right and left, forty villages.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Pineda’s map shows the Mississippi as if it had a wide mouth, growing
wider like a bay in going inland, and it has no representation of the
delta; but this river and the several others tributary to the gulf are all
mapped only at their mouths. What he meant for the Mississippi is more
clearly indicated by the map sent to Spain by Cortes and published there
in 1524, which shows the Rio del Espiritu Santo flowing through two
lakes close to its mouth, evidently intended to represent Lakes Pontchartrain
and Borgne. The same delineation of the Lower Mississippi is
given also by the Turin map, of about the year 1523. Both these maps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>doubtless based on information supplied by Pineda, display the course of
the Mississippi above Lake Pontchartrain to a distance of apparently at
least a hundred miles, where it is represented as formed by three confluent
streams. Through questioning the Indians, he probably learned of the
Red river, and of its northern tributary, the Black, which would be
the two inflowing streams at nearly the distance mentioned from
Pontchartrain.</p>

<p class='c015'>The little ships of Pineda’s expedition therefore must be supposed,
according to these maps, to have entered the Mississippi by one of its
numerous outflowing navigable bayous, which, before the construction of
levees, discharged a considerable part of the waters of the great river
through Lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrain, and Borgne. The Indian town
noted at the mouth of the river may have been at the mouth of the bayou,
that is, on or near Lake Maurepas; or it may have been near the chief
place of outflow from the main river, which was most probably then, as
in recent times, at Bayou Manchac, 117 miles above the site of New
Orleans by the course of the river, and 14 miles below Baton Rouge.
There is no reason to distrust the statement that within six leagues thence
up the Mississippi the Spaniards observed forty groups of temporary or
permanent Indian dwellings. If the ships only entered the mouth of the
bayou (or of the Amite river, through which the several bayous send their
waters to the lake), being there careened and repaired, it is easy to infer
that some of the Spaniards ascended the Amite and Bayou Manchac in
small boats to the Mississippi, noted the width of that mighty stream,
sounded its great depth, and reported its Indian villages. The delta,
jutting out as a long cape, was neglected by Pineda in his mapping, which
was accepted generally by cartographers. The chart of Vespucci’s first
voyage, more truthful as to this river’s embouchure, had been lost and
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c015'>Harrisse, from a thorough study of records of Pineda’s cruise, concludes
that he came to the Mississippi in April or May, 1519, remained
at the Indian town forty days, as stated, and went onward, exploring the
coast of Louisiana and Texas, in June and July. He coasted beyond the
Panuco river, but turned back when he reached the neighborhood of Vera
Cruz, already occupied by Cortes. The next year Pineda again voyaged
to the Panuco, with many men and horses, to establish a colony, in which
endeavor he and most of his company were killed by the Indians.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next expedition noting the Mississippi river was under the command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of Pamphilo (or Panfilo) de Narvaez, for exploration and colonization
of the country north of the Gulf of Mexico, from Florida westward
nearly to the Panuco river, over which he had been given the title of
governor. Grandly but ignorantly planned, this expedition was most
utterly disastrous. Out of the three hundred men who began it, only
Cabeza de Vaca, the historian of their shipwrecks and wanderings, with
three others, survived to reach Spanish settlements.</p>

<p class='c015'>In April, 1528, after a stormy voyage from Cuba, Narvaez landed
on the west coast of Florida, probably at Tampa Bay. Amid great hardships,
the expedition, mostly afoot, but having forty horses, marched
through woods and swamps, crossed rivers, found an Indian town called
Apalachen, and, finally turning back, came again to the sea, probably at
the site of St. Mark’s, about fifty miles east of the Appalachicola River.
Not finding his ships, on which he expected to re-embark, Narvaez consulted
his followers, and they decided, although destitute of tools, to construct
boats and voyage westward along the coast. More than forty had
died of disease and hunger, and ten had been killed within sight of their
camp and boat-building, by arrows of Indian foes, before they embarked,
late in September, reduced to the number of two hundred and forty-seven,
in five frail vessels, to be propelled by oars, but also provided with sails.
They had no adequate means to carry water, and consequently suffered
terribly from thirst, as well as hunger. On the sea they were in great
peril during storms; and on landing they were assailed by the Indians with
stones and arrows.</p>

<p class='c015'>About the end of October the wretched flotilla reached the Mississippi,
of which Cabeza de Vaca wrote in his Relation, as translated by
Buckingham Smith:</p>

<p class='c016'>“My boat, which was first, discovered a point made by the land,
and, against a cape opposite, passed a broad river. I cast anchor
near a little island forming the point, to await the arrival of the other
boats. The Governor did not choose to come up, and entered a bay
near by in which were a great many islets. We came together there,
and took fresh water from the sea, the stream entering it in freshet.
To parch some of the maize we brought with us, since we had eaten it
raw for two days, we went on an island; but finding no wood we
agreed to go to the river beyond the point, one league off. By no
effort could we get there, so violent was the current on the way,
which drove us out, while we contended and strove to gain the land.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>The north wind, which came from the shore, began to blow so
strongly that it forced us to sea without our being able to overcome
it. We sounded half a league out, and found with thirty fathoms we
could not get bottom; but we were unable to satisfy ourselves that
the current was not the cause of failure.”</p>

<p class='c015'>During the next week the boats, being rowed and drifted westward,
were separated by storms; that of Narvaez may have foundered; others
were driven ashore and wrecked. Those of the men who escaped from
the sea mostly perished by hunger and cold, while some were enslaved by
the Indians. Cabeza de Vaca was held in servitude on and near the island
where he was wrecked, probably the island of Galveston, during about six
years. Thence escaping, with two Spaniards and a negro of their company,
he wandered across Texas, Chihuahua, and Sonora, securing the
friendly aid of the Indians all the way, and coming to Spanish settlements
on the Pacific coast, near the mouth of the Gulf of California, at the end
of March, 1536. The next year he returned to Spain, where his Relation
was published in 1542. A map of his wanderings was made in Mexico
for the viceroy, but it has not been preserved. No addition to the knowledge
of the Mississippi was derived from this expedition.</p>

<p class='c015'>Grander, equally foolhardy, and scarcely less direful in its experiences,
was the expedition of Hernando (Ferdinand) de Soto, similarly planned
for discoveries, conquest, and the establishment of a colonial government.
He attained to a possession of the country granted to him, but only by
burial in its great river.</p>

<p class='c015'>By a strange infatuation, Cabeza de Vaca, arriving in Spain, and
being questioned by his kinsfolk, gave them the impression that Florida,
then including a large region northwest of the peninsula, was “the richest
country in the world.” This was near the truth, if understood with reference
to capabilities for agriculture; but the Spaniards pictured such wealth
of gold and silver as had been recently plundered from Peru and Mexico.
A soldier of fortune, De Soto, who was of noble lineage, formerly poor,
but who had become suddenly rich with Pizarro from the spoils of Peru,
was eager for greater wealth and power. Returning to Spain he secured
appointment as governor of Cuba, with a commission to extend Spanish
dominion over Florida and the country north of the Gulf of Mexico,
where he was to be the feudal lord and governor. It was the same commission
as that which had lured Narvaez to his death; but it was thought
to be a sure passport to great wealth.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Many young gentlemen of the noblest families in Spain, and some
from Elvas in Portugal, flocked to De Soto’s standard. One of the
Portuguese, whose name is unknown, wrote the narrative, published in
1557, which is our chief source of information concerning the route and
history of the expedition. An English translation of this Relation of “A
Gentleman of Elvas,” made by Richard Hakluyt, was published in 1611,
and was reprinted for the Hakluyt Society in 1851. Another translation,
by Buckingham Smith, from which ensuing quotations are taken, was published
in New York by the Bradford Club in 1866.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were more volunteers than could be accepted; and after an
exultant voyage to Cuba and thence to Florida, De Soto landed, with about
600 men and 213 horses, at Tampa Bay, May 30 (old style), 1539.</p>

<p class='c015'>Almost two years were spent in marches through inhospitable forests
and swamps, fording rivers, and fighting with many tribes of Indians, but
finding nothing worth plundering. After much suffering in the winter
camps, in the spring of 1541 the weary and wellnigh despairing expedition
came to the Mississippi River, probably at the Lower Chickasaw Bluff
(in Memphis, Tennessee, and extending ten miles down the east bank of
the river), near the northwest corner of the present state of Mississippi,
at the distance of about four hundred miles north of the Gulf, but twice
as far by the tortuous watercourse. Armed Indians in two hundred
canoes, coming from up the river, saluted the Spaniards, and the chief
said to De Soto “that he had come to visit, serve, and obey him; for he
had heard that he was the greatest of lords, the most powerful on all the
earth.” The Indians were doubtless treacherous; but here, as usual, the
Spaniards were the first aggressors. When the canoes drew off from the
shore, “the crossbow-men, who were in readiness,” according to the
Portuguese Relation, “with loud cries shot at the Indians, and struck
down five or six of them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Delay for thirty days was required in making four large boats to
transfer the cavalry and foot soldiers across the river. Beginning one
morning three hours before daybreak, by many trips to and fro, they had
all crossed before the sun was two hours high, effecting this important
movement without molestation by their vigilant Indian enemies.
Wherever they marched, the poor native people were robbed, some of
them were treacherously killed, and others, taken captive, were compelled
to carry burdens, or otherwise to aid the invaders. The Relation says of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>this river, which it calls the Rio Grande: “The distance [to cross it] was
near half a league: a man standing on the shore could not be told, whether
he were a man or something else, from the other side. The stream was
swift, and very deep; the water, always flowing turbidly, brought along
from above many trees and much timber, driven onward by its force.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Nearly another year was spent in marches, exploration, and campaigning
against the Indians, west of the Mississippi, and on April 17,
1542, De Soto came again to the Mississippi, at the Indian town of
Guachoya, close below the mouth of the Arkansas river. There he sank
into a deep despondency, worn out by the long series of disappointments
and losses which had attended the whole course of his expedition; he
became sick with malarial fever; and on May 21 he died, after appointing
Luis de Moscoso as his successor in command. To conceal his death from
the Indians, the body, wrapped in blankets and heavily weighted with
sand, was sunk in the middle part of the Mississippi. The new governor
and leader, Moscoso, then told the chief of the Guachoya Indians that
De Soto “had ascended into the skies, as he had done on many other
occasions; but as he would have to be detained there some time, he had left
him in his stead.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Moscoso, after consulting the other officers, decided to march southwestward,
hoping to reach Mexico; and half a year was lost in going far
southwest, repenting, and returning to the Mississippi at an Indian settlement
called Aminoya, where the Spaniards found a large quantity of
maize, indispensable for their sustenance. This place was a short distance
above Guachoya, and apparently above the mouths of the Arkansas and
White rivers, on the same (west) side of the great river. Seven brigantines
were there built, on which, July 2, 1543, the Spaniards, reduced
to three hundred and twenty-two, embarked to go down the Mississippi,
taking with them about a hundred Indian slaves to be sold if they should
reach Spanish settlements. Two weeks were occupied in descending the
river, by rowing and the aid of the strong current, covering a distance
which was estimated as about 250 Portuguese or Spanish leagues. (From
the mouth of the Arkansas to the Bayou Manchac, by the course of the
Mississippi, is a distance of 446 miles, and to the present mouths of the
delta, 672 miles.) The debouchure of the Mississippi was described as
follows:</p>

<p class='c016'>“When near the sea, it becomes divided into two arms, each of
which may be a league and a half broad.... Half a league
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>before coming to the sea, the Christians cast anchor, in order to take
rest for a time, as they were weary from rowing.... [Here Indians
came, in several canoes, for an attack.]... There also came
some by land, through thicket and bog, with staves, having very
sharp heads of fish-bone, who fought valiantly those of us who went
out to meet them.... After remaining two days, the
Christians went to where that branch of the river enters the sea; and
having sounded there, they found forty fathoms depth of water.
Pausing then, the Governor required that each should give his opinion
respecting the voyage, whether they should sail to New Spain direct,
by the high sea, or go thither keeping along from shore to shore....
It was decided to go along from one to another
shore....</p>

<p class='c016'>“On the eighteenth day of July the vessels got under weigh,
with fair weather, and wind favorable for the voyage.... With
a favorable wind they sailed all that day in fresh water, the next
night, and the day following until vespers, at which they were
greatly amazed; for they were very distant from the shore, and so
great was the strength of the current of the river, the coast so shallow
and gentle, that the fresh water entered far into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Luis Hernandez de Biedma, a factor or agent for King Charles V,
was a member of De Soto’s expedition, of which, after returning to Spain,
he submitted a report in 1544. From the translation of that report, given
by Buckingham Smith in the same volume with this narrative of “The
Gentleman of Elvas,” we have the following considerably different
description of what was thought to be the junction of the Mississippi with
the gulf:</p>

<p class='c017'>“We came out by the mouth of the river, and entering into a
very large bay made by it, which was so extensive that we passed
along it three days and three nights, with fair weather, in all the time
not seeing land, so that it appeared to us we were at sea, although we
found the water still so fresh that it could well be drunk, like that of
the river. Some small islets were seen westward, to which we went:
thenceforward we kept close along the coast, where we took shell-fish,
and looked for other things to eat, until we entered the River of
Panuco, where we came and were well received by the Christians.”</p>

<p class='c015'>By comparing Biedma’s report with the Portuguese Relation, I am
convinced that the brigantines did not pass down the Mississippi to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>delta, but went out to the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Bayou Manchac,
Lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrain and Borgne, and Mississippi Sound. In
other words, Moscoso, with his squadron, took the same passage that
Pineda had taken, in 1519, for his entering the Mississippi. Several
points in the two narratives need now to be explained in detail, as to their
harmony with this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c015'>First, the Indians had villages near the Bayou Manchac; but
probably there were no inhabitants near the true mouth of the river, at
the end of the delta. Second, under this view, we must regard the Portuguese
statement of a division of the river, into two arms or branches, as
referring to the large outflow, at a time of flood, to the Atchafalaya
River. Instead of receiving an inflow at the junction of the Red River,
the flooded Mississippi there sent out a portion of its current, by the
mouth of the Red, to the Atchafalaya; which also, when the Red is at a
higher stage than the Mississippi, takes a part of the current of the
former, carrying it south by a much shorter course to the Gulf. Third,
another statement of the Relation, noting the great depth of forty
fathoms where their branch of the river “enters the sea,” must be then
interpreted as found in the bend of the Mississippi from which the Bayou
Manchac flows away.</p>

<p class='c015'>In its condition of a high flood, the river there opens toward a vast
expanse of water, called, by the narrator, “the sea,” reaching east over
Lake Maurepas and onward to the Gulf. It seems indeed not unlikely
that the Mississippi at that place may have then had even so great a
depth; for in a sharp curve at New Orleans it was once found by the
Mississippi River Commission to have a sounding of 208 feet. On the
large scale maps recently published by the Commission, the maximum
depth of the river close to the departure of the Bayou Manchac is noted
as 145 feet; and in the sharp bend in the east part of New Orleans,
188 feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sailing on the wide Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, with the very
low lands inclosing the latter probably then submerged, Moscoso and his
men would regard all that expanse of fresh water, reaching from the
Bayou Manchac nearly a hundred miles east to the Mississippi Sound, as
“a very large bay” of the sea. They would consequently be surprised at
the very long distance to which the Mississippi sent its waters without
their becoming salt; whereas even the greatest floods could not freshen
the sea very far out from the mouths of the delta. The Portuguese Relation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>says that the Mississippi, before the departure from Aminoya, had
risen, in such a high flood, to the ground at the town, where the brigantines
were built, floating them; and we may infer, with good assurance, that
the same flood continued, at nearly its full height, through the next two
weeks, till July 16, when they came to Bayou Manchac and the vast fresh
water expanse stretching thence far to the east.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fifty-two days were spent in slow coasting, with frequent landings,
and long delays for storms and to provide shell-fish for food, between the
Mississippi and the Panuco River, which was entered September 10, 1543;
and there the Spanish town of Panuco welcomed the surviving three
hundred and eleven of De Soto’s men.</p>

<p class='c015'>Looking back over the history of this expedition and its results, we
see that little was gained for geographic knowledge, and nothing for the
honor of Spain or the extension of her colonies. With the clearer light
which now enables all civilized nations to recognize the great truth of the
brotherhood of all mankind, we are pained to read, throughout this narrative,
of the wanton cruelties, murderous warfare, dishonesty and shameless
perfidy, with which the Indians were treated by De Soto and his men
from the beginning to the end of their expedition. These men were the
finished product of medieval chivalry; they had mostly an inordinate self-esteem;
and they called themselves Christians, and De Soto died with
Christian serenity, in penitence and faith; but in their conduct toward the
savages every Christian or humane sentiment was sacrificed to the love of
gold and self-advancement. The first white men to voyage far on the
Mississippi, and to deal largely with its native people, deemed them outside
the pale of human sympathy or mercy.</p>

<p class='c015'>No geographer, nor expert draftsman for mapping, appears to
have been enlisted by De Soto in his grand company of followers. But
soon after the expedition was disbanded in Mexico, testimony of those
who came back to Europe was taken by some unknown compiler as the
basis for a revised map of the “Gulf and Coast of New Spain.” This
map, preserved at Madrid in the Archives of the Indies, was lately
ascribed to the year 1521, in the exhibition sent by Spain to the Columbian
Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It is reproduced by Harrisse in his great
work, <cite>The Discovery of North America</cite>, and is proved by him to belong
to the end of 1543 or some later date. It shows the Atlantic and Gulf
coasts, from Georgia to the Panuco river, and extends inland as far as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>country was known, however vaguely, from the explorations of De Soto
and Moscoso. The ultimate sources of the Mississippi river, called by
Biedma and on this map the Espiritu Santo, are placed on the northwestern
flank of the Appalachian mountain belt, due north of Tampa Bay.
Thence two streams, meant for the Tennessee and Cumberland (or perhaps
Ohio) rivers, of which De Soto had accounts from the Indians, flow
west and unite to form the Espiritu Santo, near whose west bank, close
below the confluence of a large tributary from the northwest, is Guachoya,
the place of De Soto’s death. Many other names are also noted, mostly
of towns or districts of Indian tribes, derived from his expedition. No
indication of the Ohio (probably) nor the Missouri, nor of the Red
river as a tributary of the Mississippi, is given by this map. Its northern
boundary, beyond which it has only blank space, is at the supposed Cumberland
river, and at the mountains adjoining the sources of the northwestern
tributary, that is, the Arkansas river. The Mississippi empties
into the Vaya (Bay) del Espiritu Santo, which is also called Mar Pequeña
(Little Sea), taking the place of the lakes north of New Orleans, and
thus confirming my conclusions as to Moscoso’s passage into the Gulf.
Excepting the long tributaries from the northeast, no greater prominence
is given to the Mississippi than to several others of the many rivers pouring
into the Atlantic and the Gulf along all this coast.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here cartography rested during a hundred and thirty years. The
next contribution from exploration of the Mississippi was by Marquette’s
map in 1673.</p>

<p class='c015'>These studies, indicating that Pineda and Moscoso came and went
through the large lakes north of New Orleans, answer the question asked
by Dr. Walter B. Scaife in 1892, doubting that Pineda entered the
Mississippi, and considering instead that the Rio del Espiritu Santo on
the maps sent to Spain by Garay and Cortes represents Mobile River and
Bay. This view is elaborately stated by Scaife in the Johns Hopkins
University <cite>Studies in Historical and Political Science</cite>, Vol. XIII (Supplement,
pages 139–176). Among other historians who have adopted
this view are Peter J. Hamilton (in <cite>Colonial Mobile</cite>, 1897), and
Prof. Alcée Fortier, president of the Louisiana Historical Society (in
<cite>A History of Louisiana</cite>, 1904). But their difficulties and objections
against identifying the Mississippi as the great river where Pineda
careened and repaired his vessels are removed by his coming through
Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Not until a hundred and eighty years later, in 1699, have we any
historic records of entry or departure through the delta mouths of the
Mississippi. Then, on the second day of March, Iberville and Bienville,
brothers destined to become illustrious by founding the French
colony of Louisiana, entered the eastern mouth of the delta with rowing
boats; and in September a small English frigate entered one of the mouths
and ascended the river to “English Turn,” a great bend ten miles below
the site of New Orleans.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE RECORD OF REDDING</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c018'>Mr. Grumman has produced a wholly novel and unique work<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
of a character never before attempted so far as we are aware.
It is a record of the services and sufferings of the Revolutionary
patriots of a Connecticut town, which through its sons made history and
influenced public opinion in a much greater degree than its position and
importance would have promised. It is a record also of the loyalists of
the town, who suffered even more for their King and Cause than did the
patriots, since defeat and banishment with confiscation of their estates
was their final portion.</p>

<p class='c015'>Redding (formerly written Reading) is one of the “hill towns,” of
Connecticut, seven miles from Danbury and thirteen from Bridgeport,
the two “shire towns,” of Fairfield County. Its people have always
been noted for brain force and intelligence. The number of its sons
who have won high places in the professions, in art, literature, diplomacy,
the army and navy is something remarkable. At the outbreak of the
Revolution it was the seat of a polite and learned society far superior to
that of the average country town of the day.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Grumman divides his book into two parts—“Military History,”
(a terse and simple account of the campaigns in which Redding soldiers
figured, with incidents) and “Revolutionary Soldiers and Patriots of
Redding,” a series of biographies which is the larger and more valuable
portion of the work. In Part I he first sketches in sharp outline the two
opposing forces which the troubles with England created in Redding as
elsewhere—the patriots and tories. The former organized their
“American Association,” the latter—very numerous and respectable in
Redding—formed their “Redding Loyalist Association,” (perhaps the
first of the kind in America), in February, 1775.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In the present critical situation of publick affairs,” to quote its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>preamble this Association adopted a set of “Resolves” which were published
in James Rivington’s <cite>Gazette</cite> for Feb. 23, 1775, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'><i>First.</i> <i>Resolved</i>, That while we enjoy the privileges and
immunities of the British Constitution we will render all due obedience
to his most Gracious Majesty King George the Third, and that
a firm dependence on the Mother Country is essential to our political
safety and happiness.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Second.</i> <i>Resolved</i>, That the privileges and immunities of this
Constitution are yet (in a good degree) continued to all his
Majesty’s American subjects, except those who, we conceive, have
justly forfeited their right thereto.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Third.</i> <i>Resolved</i>, That we supposed the Continental Congress
was constituted for the purpose of restoring harmony between
Great Britain and her colonies and removing the displeasure of his
Majesty toward his American subjects, whereas on the contrary
some of their resolutions appear to us immediately calculated to
widen the present unhappy breach, counteract the first principles of
civil society, and in a great degree abridge the privileges of their
constituents.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Fourth.</i> <i>Resolved</i>, That notwithstanding we will in all circumstances
conduct with prudence and moderation we consider it an
indispensable duty we owe to our King and Constitution, our Country
and posterity, to defend, maintain and preserve at the risk of
our lives and properties the prerogatives of the Crown, and the
privileges of the subject from all attacks by any rebellious body of
men, any Committees of Inspection, Correspondence, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c017'>(“Signed by one hundred and forty one Inhabitants whose
names are to be seen at the Printer’s.”—adds Rivington.)</p>

<p class='c015'>The effect of this document on the patriots of Redding was like that
of a red rag on a bull. They at once set to work to discover its signers
and presently made public in a circular the entire list so far as they
belonged in Redding. It was given out by the Committee of Observation
under this preamble.</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Whereas</span>, There was a certain number of resolves published—and
whereas said Resolves are injurious to the rights of this
Colony and breathe a spirit of enmity and opposition to the rights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>and liberties of all America and are in direct opposition to the Association
of the Continental Congress: and notwithstanding said
resolutions were come into with a (seeming) view to secure the said
signers some extraordinary privileges and immunities, yet either
through negligence in the printer or upon design of the subscribers,
said signed names are not made publick—and now if there be any
advantage in adopting those principles we are willing they should
be entitled there to; and for which end and for the more effectual
carrying into execution said Association we have taken some pains
and by the assistance of him who carried said resolves to said Printer
we have obtained the whole of said names. But as we mean not to
publish the names of any except those who belong to said Reading,
their names are as follows.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Some seventy-four names follow, and then this note:</p>

<p class='c017'>“There are only forty two Freeholders in the above number;
there are several minors, &#38;c., to make the above number of seventy
four that belong to said Reading, and we hereby hold them up to
the publick as opposers to the Association of said Congress.</p>

<p class='c017'>Signed by order of the Committee of Observation for said
Town of Reading.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Ebenezer Couch</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Chairman</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The Loyalist Association met this challenge by boldly publishing in
Rivington’s <cite>Gazette</cite> the entire list of signers, and the battle began. The
course of events very soon brought many of the loyalist signers into
hearty accord with the patriots, as Mr. Grumman shows, but those who
persisted were treated with such severity that they fled to the forests and
caves, where they were concealed until they could escape to the British
lines.</p>

<p class='c015'>Free Masons will be interested in Mr. Grumman’s account of the
making of American Union Lodge, among the officers of the Continental
Line while the right wing of the Continental Army lay in winter
quarters in Redding, 1778–9. “During the siege of Boston,” he says,
“the meetings of the Grand Lodge&#160;... were suspended and a commission
was granted by John Rowe (the successor of Gen. Joseph Warren
as Grand Master), to Col. Joel Clark of the Connecticut troops to establish
a lodge within the army, which was to hold its meetings whenever

be designated “The American Union Lodge.” It was accordingly
organized, but the change of base to New York and the stirring events
which followed seem to have prevented further meetings. Its Master,
Col. Clark, died after the Long Island campaign and the Lodge appears
to have lapsed until the encampment at Redding brought the Connecticut
officers together with leisure to renew their fraternal relations. For this
purpose the Lodge was convened early in February, in conformity to the
following notice:</p>

<p class='c017'>“On the application of a number of gentlemen, brethren of
the Ancient and Honorable Society of Free and Accepted Masons,
to the members of American Union Lodge held by authority under
the Right Worshipful John Rowe Esq. Grand Master of all Masons
in North America, where no Grand Master is appointed, requesting
that the said American Union Lodge meet for the purpose of re-establishing
the Ancient Craft in the same. Agreeable to which a summons
was issued desiring the members of the American Union Lodge
to meet at Widow Sanford’s, near Reading Olde Meeting House,
on Monday the 15th of inst. February at 4 o’clock post m. and an
invitation sent to the others, the brethren of the Ancient and Honorable
Society of Free and Accepted Masons to attend at 5 o’clock

<p class='c015'>At this first meeting Gen. Samuel H. Parsons was elected Master in
place of Col. Clark, deceased.</p>

<p class='c015'>Several meetings of the Lodge were held while the Army lay at
Redding, two of which were attended by Washington (though Mr.
Grumman does not note the fact). On March 22 it held a dinner at
Esq. Hawley’s, “the Rev. Dr. Evans and a number of gentlemen and
ladies being present,” and a “Grand Banquet” on April 7th, four days
before orders came for the Army to prepare to leave. A very full
account of this is given by Mr. Grumman in a quotation from the Lodge
records:</p>

<p class='c015'>It having been voted to dine at three o’clock, at half past one the
procession began as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>1.  Br. Whitney, Outside Tyler.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>2. The Wardens with white rods.</p>

Entered Apprentice March.</p>

<p class='c015'>The W. Master and Brethren having seated themselves together
with a number of respectable Inhabitants, gentlemen and ladies, the Rev.
Doct. Evans delivered a discourse suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c015'>After dinner the W. Master called on Bro. Munson and others for
songs and sentiments when the company were favored with the following,
each song and toast being enlivened with appropriate music.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>At six o’clock the procession returned to the Lodge room and the
Lodge being opened it was,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Voted, That the thanks of the lodge be presented in writing

this day, and that Bro. Waldo wait on him with the same;
also that Bro. Waldo present our thanks to the Rev. Mr. Bartlett
and to the other gentlemen and ladies who favored the lodge with
their company at dinner.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Todd, in his History of Redding gives one of the songs sung on this
occasion.</p>

<p class='c015'>But it is in his biographical record of the patriots and loyalists of
Redding that Mr. Grumman’s book is most original and valuable. There
are one hundred pages of these, compiled with an accuracy and fullness
surprising to one who realizes the paucity of material of this sort now
extant and the difficulty of securing it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Joel Barlow, poet, statesman, and earlier, Chaplain in the Army was
one of the most distinguished of these. Mr. Grumman has a very interesting
extract from the diary of the Rev. Eleazer Wheelock, dated Sept.
14, 1773, regarding young Joel’s matriculation at Moor’s preparatory
school in Hanover, N. H., not given by any of the poet’s biographers so
far as we are aware.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Samuel Barlow of Reading, Mass, (Ct.?) brings his
son Joel to school. The said son is to officiate as waiter on table at
meal time and also to be at the beck of Miss Elizabeth: only in play
time and vacations to perform such errands and incidental service
as she shall have occasion for in her business, and in consideration of
her services and his to have his board, viz: eating, drinking, washing,
firewood, candles, study room and tuition.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This Miss Elizabeth Burr was of Fairfield, Conn., near Reading,
and came to have charge of Joel, and to “superintend the cooking in
commons and manage the prudentials of it.” She was probably a relative
and did this to aid the boy in getting an education, his father having
a family of ten to provide for.</p>

<p class='c015'>A typical Reading patriot was the Rev. Nathaniel Bartlett who
served the Congregational Church there as pastor for fifty-seven years,
and who when hostilities broke out brought his sword, freshly ground, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>his son Daniel, and bade him go and defend his country. Another was
Lemuel Sanford, who represented Redding at twenty-two sessions of the
General Assembly, covering a period of twenty years, served on numerous
committees and died a Judge of the County Court.</p>

<p class='c015'>The greatest patriot of all, and one of the greatest of the historic
struggle, William Heron, Mr. Grumman places among the loyalists.
This man was an Irishman, born in Cork in 1742, of good family and
educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He was the intimate personal
friend of Lord Howe, and the friend and trusted adviser of Washington
and Putnam. Howe’s well known leniency toward the Americans was
perhaps due to him, and the minute knowledge the patriot chiefs had of
the British forces, and the plans of their leaders came largely from
him. He was a shrewd, tactful, forceful, brilliant man with all an Irishman’s
power of blarney, and hating the British as a loyal Irishman
should, he yet hoodwinked Sir Henry Clinton, and his Adjutant General,
Major Oliver DeLancey, into the belief that he was secretly an adherent
of the British cause, and could give them valuable information. For
years—with the full knowledge of Washington and Putnam—he maintained
a correspondence with them, was allowed to come into the city of
New York, was dined and wined by them, went freely about the city, and
obtained information of the greatest value to the patriot leaders. What
information he gave the British in return was either of no great importance,
or would have come to them by some other channel. In Clinton’s
“Record of Private Intelligence,” discovered in London in 1882, and
purchased by Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> there are several letters from
this man, some of them implicating Major General Samuel H. Parsons,
of Connecticut, in treasonable intercourse with the British, but this was
only a part of the plot. The career of Heron during the eight years of
the war would furnish material for a dozen historical romances. Mr.
Grumman prints a letter from Parsons to Washington, dated Apr. 6,
1782 in which he says of him:</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is a native of Ireland, a man of very large knowledge,
and a great share of natural sagacity united with a sound judgment,
but of as unmeaning a countenance as any person in my acquaintance.
With this appearance he is as little suspected as any man
can be. An officer in the department of the Adjutant General is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>countryman and very intimate acquaintance of Mr. Heron, through
which channel he has been able frequently to obtain important and
very interesting information.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Parsons adds that he knows him to be a consistent National Whig,
always in the field in every alarm and in every trial proving himself a
man of bravery. Corroborative proof of this view is found in the fact
that after the war, instead of being run off to Nova Scotia with the other
loyalists, Heron represented Redding in seventeen sessions of the General
Assembly, and was given other offices of importance by his townsmen.</p>

<p class='c015'>A typical loyalist of Redding was John Lyon, a farmer and business
man, who owned one hundred acres of land in the town with two houses
thereon, beside a half interest in a schooner and much merchandise. This
man not only signed the “Reading Resolves,” but carried them to Rivington,
the King’s Printer in New York, who printed them. For this
act in March, 1775, he was seized by a mob, ill treated and robbed, and
his merchandise at Mill River (now Southport) to the value of five hundred
pounds was also seized. The persecution continued until he was
obliged to fly to the British lines, where he entered the King’s service,
aided in raising the “King’s Rangers,” a loyalist regiment, and acted as
guide during the war. At the close of the war he fled to Nova Scotia
with his wife and two sons and settled at Kingston.</p>

<p class='c015'>In his memorial to the King from which the above facts are taken,
he estimates his losses at £1,790, and was allowed £290 in satisfaction
(?) thereof.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c013'>II.<br> CONFEDERATE FINANCE IN ALABAMA</h3>
<h4 class='c013'>SPECIAL APPROPRIATIONS AND SALARIES.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Besides the regular appropriations for the usual expenses of the
government, there were many extraordinary appropriations.
These, of course, were the war expenses and were far greater than
the ordinary expenses. The chief item of these extraordinary appropriations
was for the support of the indigent families of soldiers, and for this
purpose about $11,000,000 was provided. For the military defense of
the State several million dollars were appropriated, much of this being
spent for arms and clothing for the Alabama troops, both in the Confederate
and the State service. Money was granted to the University of
Alabama and other military schools on condition that they furnish drill
masters for the State troops without charge. Hospitals were furnished
in Virginia and in Alabama for the Alabama soldiers. The gunboat
<i>Florida</i> was bought for the defense of Mobile, and $150,000 was appropriated
for an ironclad ram for the same purpose. Loans were made to
commanders of regiments to buy clothing for their soldiers, and the
State began to furnish clothing, $50,000 being appropriated at one time
for clothing for the Alabama soldiers in Northern prisons. By March
12, 1862, Alabama had contributed $317,600 to the support of the army
of Northern Virginia.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Much was expended in the manufacture of salt
in Alabama and in Virginia, which was sold at cost or given away to the
poor; in the purchase of salt from Louisiana to be sold at a low price, and
in bounties paid to salt-makers in the State who sold salt at reasonable
prices. The State also paid for medical attendance for the indigent
families of soldiers. When the records and rolls of the Alabama troops
in the Confederate service were lost, money was appropriated to have new
ones made. Frequent grants were made to the various benevolent societies
of the State whose object was to care for the maimed and sick
soldiers, and the widows and orphans. Cotton and wool cards and agricultural
implements were purchased and distributed among the poor.
Slaves and supplies were taken for the public service and the owners
compensated.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>The appropriations for the usual expenses of the government were
light, seldom more than twice the appropriations in times of peace, notwithstanding
the depreciated currency. The public officers who received
stated salaries ranged from $1,500 to $4,000 a year in State money.
In 1862, the salaries of the professors in the State University were
doubled on account of the depreciated currency, the president receiving
$5,000 and each professor $4,000.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The members of the General
Assembly were more fortunate. In 1864, they received $15 a day for the
time in session, and the clerks of the Legislature, who were disabled
soldiers or exempt from service, or were women, were paid the same
amount. The salt commissioners drew salaries of $3,000 a year in 1864
and 1865, though this amount was not sufficient to pay their board for
more than six months. Salaries were never increased in proportion to
expenses. The compensation, in December, 1864, for capturing a runaway
slave was $25, worth probably 50 cents in coin. For the inaugural
expenses of Governor Watts in 1863, $500 in paper was appropriated.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
Many laws were passed regulating and changing the fees and salaries of
public officials. In October, 1864, for example, the salaries of the State
officials, tax assessors and collectors, and judges were increased 50%.
Besides the general depreciation of the currency, the variations of values
in the different sections of the State rendered such changes necessary.
In the central part, which was safe for a long time from Union raids,
the currency was to the last worth more, and the prices of the necessaries
of life were lower, than in the more exposed regions. This fact was taken
into consideration by the Legislature when fixing the fees of the State
and county officers in the various sections.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>TAXATION.</h4>

<p class='c021'>As a result of the policy adopted at the outset of meeting the extraordinary
expenses by bond issues,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c019'><sup>[6]</sup></a> the people continued to pay the light
taxes levied before the war, and paid them in paper money. Though
falling heavily on the salaried and wage-earning classes, it was never
a burden upon the agricultural classes, except in the poorest white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>counties. The poll tax brought in little revenue. Soldiers were exempt
from its payment and from taxation on property to the amount of $500.
The widows and orphans of soldiers had similar privileges. A special
tax of 25% on the former rate was imposed on all taxable property in
November, 1861, and a year later, by acts of December 9, 1862, a far-reaching
scheme of taxation was introduced. Under this poll taxes were
levied as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>In 1863 a tax of 37½% was laid on Confederate and State bonds not
in the hands of the original purchasers;<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a> 7½% was levied on profits of
banking, railroad companies, and on evidence of debt; 5% on other profits
not included in the act of the year before. The tax on gold and silver
was to be paid in gold and silver; on bank notes, in notes; on bonds, in
coupons.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c019'><sup>[8]</sup></a> In December 1864, the taxes levied by the laws of 1862 and
1863 were increased by 33⅓%. Taxes on gold and silver were to be paid
in kind or in currency at its market value.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c019'><sup>[9]</sup></a> This was the last tax levied
by the State under Confederate rule. From these taxes the State government
was largely supplied.</p>

<p class='c015'>A number of special laws were passed to enable the county authorities
to levy taxes-in-kind or to levy a certain amount in addition to the State
tax, for the use of the county. The taxes levied by the State did not bear
heavily upon the majority of the people, as nearly all, except the well-to-do
and especially the slave owners, were exempt. The constant
depreciation of the currency acted, of course, as a tax on the wage earners
and salaried classes and on those whose income was derived from government
securities.</p>

<p class='c015'>While the State taxes were felt chiefly by the wealthier agricultural
classes and the slave owners, this was not the case with the Confederate
taxes. The loans and gifts from the State, the war tax of August 19,
1861, the $15,000,000 loan, the Produce Loan, and the proceeds of
sequestration—all had not availed to secure sufficient supplies. The Produce
Loan of 1862 was subscribed to largely in Alabama, the secretary
of the Treasury issuing stocks and bonds in return for supplies,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c019'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and
$1,500,000 of the $15,000,000 loan was raised in the State. Still the
Confederate government was in desperate need. The farmers would not
willingly sell their produce for currency which was constantly decreasing
in value, and, when selling at all, they were forced to charge exorbitant
prices because of the high prices charged them for everything by the
speculators.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c019'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The speculator also ran up the prices of supplies beyond
the reach of the government purchasing agents, who had to buy according
to the list of prices issued by impressment commissioners. So in the
spring of 1863, all other expedients were cast aside and the Confederate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>government levied the most drastic sort of a tax. No more
loans of paper money from the State, no more assumption of war taxes
by the State because the people were opposed to any form of direct taxation,
no more holding back of supplies by producers and speculators who
refused to sell to the Confederate government except for coin—the
new law stopped all that.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c019'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>First there was a tax of 8% on all agricultural products in hand on
July 1, 1863, on salt, wine and liquors, and 1% on all money and credits.
Second, an occupation tax ranging from $50 to $200 and from 2½% to
20% of their gross sales was levied on bankers, auctioneers, brokers, druggists,
butchers, “fakirs,” liquor dealers, merchants, pawn-brokers, lawyers,
physicians, photographers, brewers, and distillers; hotels paid from $30
to $500 and theatres, $500. Third, there was an income tax of 1% on
salaries from $1,000 to $1,500 and 2% on all over $1,500. Fourth, 10%
on all trade in flour, bacon, corn, oats, and dry goods during 1863. Fifth,
a tax-in-kind, by which each farmer after reserving 50 bushels of sweet
and 50 bushels of Irish potatoes, 20 bushels of peas or beans, 100 bushels
of corn or 50 bushels of wheat out of his crop of 1863, had to deliver (at
a dépôt within eight miles,) out of the remainder of his produce for that
year, 10% of all wheat, corn, oats, rye, buckwheat, rice, sweet and Irish

and peanuts; 10% of all meat killed between April 24, 1863 and March 1,

<p class='c015'>By this act $9,500,000 in currency was raised in Alabama.
Alabama, with Georgia and North Carolina, furnished two-thirds of the
tax-in-kind. Though at first there was some objection to this tax because
it bore entirely on the agricultural classes, yet it was a just tax so far as
the larger planters were concerned, since the depreciated money had
acted as a tax on the wage-earners and salaried classes, who had also some
State tax to pay. The tax-in-kind fell heavily upon the families of small
farmers in the white counties, who had no negro labor, and who produced
no more than the barest necessaries of life. To collect the tax
required an army of tithe-gatherers, and afforded fine opportunities of
escape from military service. The State was divided into districts for the
collection of all Confederate taxes, with a State collector at the head.
The collection districts were usually counties, following the State division
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>into taxing districts. In 1864, the tobacco tithe was collected by Treasury
agents and not by the quartermaster’s department, which had formerly
collected it.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c019'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The tax of April 24, 1863, was renewed on February 17,
1864, and some additional taxes laid as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>The taxes during the war, State and Confederate, were in all five
to ten times those levied before the war. Never were taxes paid more
willingly by most of the people,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c019'><sup>[16]</sup></a> though at first there was opposition to
them. It is probable that the authorities did not in 1861 and 1862 give
sufficient consideration to the fact that conditions were much changed, and
that in view of the war the people would willingly have paid taxes that
they would have rebelled against in times of peace.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the tax-in-kind for 1863, $100,000 was collected in Pickens
county alone, one of the poorest in the State. The produce was sent in
too freely to be taken care of by the government quartermasters, and, as
there was enough on hand for a year or two, much of it was ruined for
lack of storage room.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c019'><sup>[17]</sup></a> An English traveller in East Alabama in 1864
reported that there was abundance; that the tax-in-kind was working well,
and that enough provisions had already been collected for the Western
armies of the Confederacy to last until the harvest of 1865.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c019'><sup>[18]</sup></a> There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>were few railroads in the State and the rolling stock on these was scarce
and soon worn out. So the supplies gathered by the tax-in-kind law could
not be moved. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of beef and bacon, and
bushels of corn were piled up in the government warehouses and at the
dépôts, while starvation threatened the armies and the people also in districts
remote from the railroads or rivers. At the supply centers of
Alabama and along the railroads in the Black Belt there were immense
stores of provisions. When the war ended, notwithstanding the destruction
by raids, great quantities of corn and bacon were seized or destroyed
by the Northern troops.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c019'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'>IMPRESSMENT.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The State quite early began to secure supplies by impressment. Salt
was probably the first article to which it laid claim. Later the officials were
authorized to impress and pay for supplies necessary for the public service.
In 1862, the Governor was authorized to impress shoes and
leather, and other shoemakers’ materials for the use of the army. The
Legislature appropriated $250,000 to pay for impressments under this
law.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c019'><sup>[20]</sup></a> In case of a refusal to comply with an order of impressment, the
sheriff was authorized to summon a <i>posse comitatus</i> of not less than twenty
men and seize double the quantity first impressed. In such cases no compensation
was given.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c019'><sup>[21]</sup></a> The people resisted the impressment of their
property. By a law of October 31, 1862, the Governor was impowered
to impress slaves, and tools and teams for them to work with, in the
public service against the enemy, and $1,000,000 was appropriated to
pay the owners.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c019'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Slaves were regularly impressed by the Confederate
officials acting in co-operation with the State authorities, for work on
fortifications and for other public service. Several thousand were at
work at Mobile at various times. They were secured usually by requisition
on the State government, which then impressed them. In December,
1864, Alabama was asked for 2,500 negroes for the Confederate service.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c019'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The people were morbidly sensitive about their slave property and there
was much discontent at the impressment of slaves even though they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>paid for. As the war drew to a close, the people were less and less willing
to have their servants impressed.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the spring of 1863, the Confederate Congress authorized the
impressment of private property for public use.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c019'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The Confederate
President and the Governor each appointed an agent, and these together
fixed the prices to be paid for the property taken.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c019'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Every two months
they published schedules of prices, which were always below the market
prices.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c019'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Evidently impressment had been going on for some time, for,
in November, 1862, Judge Dargan, member of Congress from Alabama,
wrote to the President that the people from the country were afraid to
bring produce to Mobile for fear of seizure by the government. In
November, 1863, the Secretary of War issued an order that no supplies
should be impressed when held by a person for his own consumption or
that of his employees or slaves, or while being carried to market for sale,
except in urgent cases and by order of a commanding general. Consequently
the land was filled with agents buying a year’s supply for railroad
companies, individuals, manufactories, and corporations, relief
associations, towns, and counties—all these to be protected from impressment.
Most speculators always had their goods “on the way to market
for sale.” The great demand caused prices to rise suddenly, and the
government, which had to buy by scheduled prices, could not compete with
private purchasers; yet it could not legally impress. There was much
abuse of the impressment law, especially by unauthorized persons. It
was the source of much lawless conduct on the part of many who claimed
to be Confederate officials, with authority to impress.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c019'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The Legislature
frequently protested against the manner of execution of the law. In
1863, a State law was passed which indicates that the people had been
suffering from the depredations of thieves who pretended to be Confederate
officials in order to get supplies. It was made a penal offense in 1862
and again in 1863, with from one to five years’ imprisonment and $500
to $5,000 fine, to falsely represent oneself as a Confederate agent, contractor
or official.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c019'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The merchants of Mobile protested against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>impressment of sugar and molasses; it would cause prices to double, they
said.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c019'><sup>[29]</sup></a> There was much complaint from sufferers who were never paid
by the Confederate authorities for the supplies impressed. Army quartermasters
would sometimes seize the necessary supplies and would leave with
the army before settling accounts with the citizens, the latter often being
left without any proof of their claim. In North Alabama, especially,
where the armies never tarried long at a place, the complaint was
greatest. To do away with this abuse resulting from carelessness, the
Secretary of War appointed agents in each Congressional district to
receive proof of claims for forage and supplies impressed.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c019'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The State
wanted a Confederate law passed to authorize receipts for supplies to be
given as part of the tax-in-kind.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c019'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The unequal operation of the impressment
system may be seen in the case of Clarke and Monroe counties.
In the former, from sixteen persons, property amounting to $1,700 was
impressed. In Monroe, from thirty-seven persons, $60,000 worth was
taken. The delay in payment was so long that it was practically worthless
when received.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c019'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS<br> <span class='large'>IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS IN THE ROYAL COLONY OF NEW YORK.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER I<br> THE PRESS IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Immediately on the introduction of printing the Church assumed
towards it an attitude at once intimate and watchful. Since all that
affected the welfare of the mind and the health of the soul was of
importance to the Church, it was not at all surprising that the demand
was at once made that nothing should be put forth by the press save that
which had received the sanction—the “Imprimatur”—of the Diocesan
authority, or later of the official delegated by the personal representative
of the Papacy. The rules that were laid down for the direction of the
printer were full and explicit, and no resistance seems to have been attempted
at the period of the Reformation in England, the power of
supervision over all forms of printing passed from the hands of the
Church to the civil authority. This followed naturally from the theory
that the King, as Head of the Church, inherited all rights of oversight in
matters of opinion and morals formerly pertaining to the Pope, and exercised
in England by the Bishops in his name. The Henrician and Elizabethan
Bishops still gave the “Imprimatur,” but it was now as representing
the King. The fact of publication without authority was in itself a
crime deserving of severe punishment.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c019'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>A further step in the restriction of printing was the establishment (in
line with the general tendencies of the time), of monopolies by patent.
In 1557 the Stationers’ Company was formed of ninety-seven London
stationers, and to it was committed the sole right to print books licensed
by the proper authority.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c019'><sup>[34]</sup></a> As representing the Sovereign, the Star Chamber
exercised a supervision over the manner in which the law was carried
out; in 1559 it ordered that all books were to read by a Bishop or a member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>of the Privy Council before going to the press, and in 1586 gave
permission for a printing press to be set up in each University, the licenser
in this case being the Vice Chancellor. In the same year the Star Chamber
ordered that all books were to be read and licensed by the Archbishop
of Canterbury or the Bishop of London, with the exception of law books
which  were to be read by the Chief Justice of either Bench or the Lord
Chief Baron.</p>

<p class='c015'>Proclamations issued by Queen Elizabeth from time to time,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c019'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
indicate the difficulty found in enforcing this monopoly and requirement of
licensing, and a proclamation issued by Elizabeth<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c019'><sup>[36]</sup></a> against “bringing
into the realm unlawful books” indicates that the statute of Henry VIII<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c019'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
repealing the permission given in the reign of Richard III to import
books from abroad<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c019'><sup>[38]</sup></a> was being systematically disregarded. Attorney-general
Popham gives witness to the same effect when in his speech before
the Star Chamber in the prosecution of Sir R. Knightley and others he
says, “Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, in her great wisdom, hath issued
proclamations that no pamphlets or treatises should be put in print but
such as should first be seen and allowed; and further, lest that were not
sufficient, she ordained that no printing should be used anywhere but in
London, Oxford, or Cambridge. Notwithstanding all this served not,
but they would print in corners and spread abroad things unprinted:
wherefore Her Majesty set forth a proclamation <i>in anno 25</i> that all
Brownist books, and such other seditious books should be suppressed
and burnt.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c019'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Star Chamber continued to exercise control over printing during
the reign of James I, but with increasing difficulty, not lessened by the
arbitrary and cruel ways in which it acted towards those whom it believed
to be breaking its rules and regulations. The flood of books printed
abroad continued into the reign of Charles I, and in 1637 we find a Star
Chamber decree, “for reducing the number of master-printers, and punishing
all others that should follow the trade, and for prohibiting as well
the impression of all new books without license, and of such as have been
licensed formerly without a new one, as the importation of all books in
the English tongue, printed abroad, and of all foreign books whatever,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>till a true catalogue has been presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and the Bishop of London, and the books themselves had been received
by their chaplains, or other learned men of their appointment, together
with the masters and wardens of the Stationers’ Company.” A printer
disobeying this order was to be fined, disabled from printing thereafter
and the printing press forfeited.</p>

<p class='c015'>The quarrel between Charles I and the Long Parliament resulted in
the abolition of the Star Chamber, but the only result, as far as the press
was concerned, was a change in masters, the Crown giving place to
Parliament. From time to time orders were issued by the Parliament<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c019'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
similar in tone to those of the Star Chamber. One dated June 14, 1643,
directs that “no book, pamphlet, paper, nor part of any such book,
pamphlet, or paper, shall from henceforth be printed, bound, stitched, or
put out to sale, by any person or persons whatsoever unless the same be
first approved and licensed under the hands of such persons as both, or
either, of the Houses, shall appoint for licensing of the same, and be
entered in the Register Book of the Company of Stationers, according to
ancient custom, and the printer thereof shall put his name thereto.” It
was in reply to this action by Parliament that Milton produced in 1644 his
“Areopagitica,” that matchless plea for freedom of speech and the
liberty of the press. “We should be wary therefore,” he writes, “what
persecution we raise against the living labours of public men, how we spill
that seasoned life of man, preserved and stored up in books; since we see
a kind of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdom; and
if it extend to the whole impression, a kind of massacre, whereof the
execution ends not in the slaying of an elemental life, but strikes at the
ethereal and fifth essence, the breath of reason itself; slays an immortality
rather than a life.”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c019'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>But these stirring words fell on ears dulled by the clamor of contending
battalions. It is true that from time to time a report of proceedings
in Parliament appeared under the title of “Diurnal Occurrences in
Parliament,” but in general Parliament was ever ready to crush at its first
appearance any spirit considered by the members to be dangerous to constituted
authority. On Sept. 30, 1647, Parliament, at the instigation of
Fairfax, passed an ordinance, “for the better regulation of printing,”
by which the restrictions were increased and a licenser appointed to whom
before printing, all manuscripts had to be presented for approbation.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>With the Restoration of Charles II the control of the press was
continued by means of the Licensing Act of 1662, passed several times
for periods of two years, finally expiring in 1679.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c019'><sup>[42]</sup></a> This was essentially
a republication of the Star Chamber order of 1637, but since the Star
Chamber no longer existed the scene was changed from that Court to the
Old Bailey. In 1679, at the trial of Henry Carr,<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c019'><sup>[43]</sup></a> indicted for some
passages in a weekly paper, the Lord Chief Justice Scroggs declared it
criminal at common law to “write on the subject of government, whether
in terms of praise or censure, it is not material; for no man has a right
to say anything of government.” In 1685, on the accession of James II,
the Licensing Act was passed for a period of seven years, and in 1692,
(during the reign of William and Mary), it was renewed for one year
and the session of the following Parliament. In 1695 the House of
Commons refused to again pass it, and in this way the Act expired, never
to be renewed, and the press was placed on a footing of equality before
the law with all other trades and occupations. And yet, as has been
well pointed out by Macaulay,<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c019'><sup>[44]</sup></a> the reasons given by the Parliament for
their action did not in any way touch on the question of the rightfulness
of a free press, but rather dealt with certain complaints in regard to the
provisions of the law and the mode of application. “This paper,” he
writes, “completely vindicates the resolution to which the Commons had
come. But it proves at the same time that they knew not what they were
doing, what a power they were calling into existence. They pointed out
concisely, clearly, forcibly, and sometimes with a grave irony which is not
unbecoming, the absurdities and iniquities of the statute which was about
to expire. But all their objections will be found to relate to matters of
detail. On the great question of principle, on the question whether the
liberty of unlicensed printing be, on the whole, a blessing or a curse to
society, not a word is said. The Licensing Act is condemned, not as a
thing essentially evil, but on account of the petty grievances, the exactions,
the jobs, the commercial restrictions, the domiciliary visits, which were
incidental to it. It is pronounced mischievous because it enables the
Company of Stationers to extort money from publishers, because it
empowers agents of the government to search houses under the authority
of general warrants, because it confines the foreign book trade to the
port of London, because it detains packages of books at the Custom
House till the pages are mildewed. The Commons complain that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>amount of the fee which the licensers may demand is not fixed. They
complain that it is made penal in an officer of the Customs to open a
box of books from abroad, except in the presence of one of the censors
of the press. How, it is very sensibly asked, is the officer to know that
there are books in the box until he has opened it?” Such were the arguments
which did what Milton’s “Areopagitica” had failed to do. But
what we mean to-day by the term, the liberty of the press, is much more
than the mere right to print without a previous application to a censor.
The position which the press holds in this generation is the result of a
slow but steady growth. After the refusal by Parliament to renew
the Licensing Act the courts still did their best to prevent the reaping of
any benefit from this. Newspaper reporting, and especially the reporting
of Parliamentary debates was frowned on by Bench and Parliament
alike. In 1722 the House of Commons passed the resolution “That
no printer or publisher of any printed newspaper do presume to insert in
any such papers any debates or other proceedings of this house or any
committee thereof” and when Edward Cave in 1731 began to publish
in his “Gentleman’s Magazine” a report of the debates he had to resort
to the fiction of a “Senate of Great Lilliput” and even then lived in
continual fear of prosecution.</p>

<p class='c015'>As time passed Parliamentary reporting came to be tacitly recognized,
but the law of libel still retained all its terrors. Bentham told the
truth when he said “Anything which any man for any reason, chooses
to be offended with is libel.” Lord Mansfield in the case of Henry
Sampson Woodfall, prosecuted for publishing a seditious libel, enunciated
the theory that the work of the jury began and ended with deciding
the fact as to whether the accused was or was not responsible for the
publication of the matter complained of, the crown, through the court, to
decide whether the matter was libellous. For twenty years the question
was fought over, and at last in 1791, Fox having changed his views in
the matter, introduced his famous bill to amend the law of libel, and in
1792 the bill became law. The importance of this act can hardly be
overestimated. After stating that “doubts have risen whether on the
trial of an indictment or information for the making and publishing any
libel, where an issue or issues are joined between the king and the defendant
or defendants, on the plea of not guilty pleaded it be competent to the
jury empanelled to try the same to give their verdict upon the whole
matter in issue.” It goes on to enact that “the jury may give a general
verdict of guilty or not guilty upon the whole matter in issue, and shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>not be required or directed by the court or judge to find the defendant
guilty merely in the proof of the publication by such defendant of the
paper charged to be a libel, and of the sense ascribed to it in the indictment
or information.” In the same spirit Judge Fitzgerald told a
jury<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c019'><sup>[45]</sup></a> “You are the sole judges of the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
The judges are here to give any help they can; but the jury are the
judges of law and fact, and on them rests the whole responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus the idea of legal restrictions on the press passes away, and the
law of libel becomes a law of the press in any case where defamation or
false report is charged, and to a jury is committed the task of deciding
whether the statement made was justified and proper. As Prof. Dicey
aptly puts it,<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c019'><sup>[46]</sup></a> “freedom of discussion is, then, in England, little else
than the right to write or say anything which a jury, consisting of twelve
shopkeepers, think it expedient should be said or written.... Whether
in any particular case a given individual is to be convicted of libel depends
wholly on their judgment, and they have to determine the questions of
truth, fairness, intention, and the like, which affect the legal character of
a published statement.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But this point of view, which is the position in England, and to a
large extent in our own land, has not been reached without a struggle,
and it is to that struggle, so far as it was carried on in the American
Colonies, that we must now turn out attention.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>ANTIQUITIES OF THE SOUTHWEST AND THEIR PRESERVATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c018'>Those who are studying the history of civilization on the American
Continent realize that the subject presents many and intricate
problems which can not be solved in this generation. Accordingly,
to preserve the material on which this study is based for the use of
future generations, is as important as are present investigations.</p>

<p class='c015'>The title of this paper suggests two classes of material to be considered.
The historian will be concerned principally with the remains
that mark the advance of the Caucasian race. The remains of the
indigenous tribes interest the ethno-archæologist.</p>

<p class='c015'>To a country so poor in archives as ours is, the possession of numerous
historic monuments, landmarks and remains of structures where
history has been made is especially fortunate and their preservation doubly
important. For a nation to cherish its own history, live in the heroic
and righteous acts of its past, is to conserve its vitality and independence.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the majority of the States we find a moderate degree of enthusiasm
for historic sites; sufficient at least to afford them adequate protection and
insure their preservation. Some far-seeing societies are alive to the significance
of the historic highways that penetrated the American wilderness
and are marking them with permanent milestones. A notable
example of this is the marking of the “Old Santa Fe Trail” by the people
of Kansas—a movement in which Colorado and New Mexico might well
join. The determination of Coronado’s line of march has occupied the
attention of careful students for many years and we may hope at some
future time to see positively determined sites on this historic way permanently
marked and recorded.</p>

<p class='c015'>The significance of our frontier has not been recognized except in
social science. Fortunately its advance is well marked. The movement
of the military frontier is preserved in monuments and military post
buildings throughout the west. Court-house corner stones record the
advance of law and order, we may say, the legal frontier—its earliest
landmarks in the far west in the form of prominent trees, high bridges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>and projecting beams, being pointed out with modest pride by the early
inhabitants as memorials of Judge Lynch and the Vigilantes. The progress
of education and religion is marked by record stones upon the public
edifices devoted to these uses. The importance of all these records should
be more generally recognized. Whenever a modern structure is to
succeed an antiquated public building, the old record stone should invariably
be preserved and reset in some conspicuous place. Future students
of history and social sciences will see in these the ancient shore-lines of
American social development.</p>

<p class='c015'>The military-religious frontier of the Spanish-American civilization
moved from south to north. Its limits are marked by the quaint old
mission churches of New Mexico and California. Some of these buildings
are still in the hands of the Church, in use and kept in repair. Some
are on the sites of long-abandoned Pueblo Indian villages, at the mercy of
the elements and the vandals. In California these splendid old landmarks
are being cared for by the organized efforts of thinking people and
we need give ourselves no concern as to their preservation. Not so in
New Mexico. Here we have ruins of five of the oldest historic structures
of which any vestiges remain on the soil of the United States, all dating
from the first half of the 17th century; all abandoned yet nobly resisting
the elements. These are the ruins of the mission churches at the
abandoned pueblos of Pecos in western San Miguel county; Giusewa in
the Jemez valley near Perea; Tabira, popularly known as “Gran
Quivira” in northeastern Socorro county, and Abo and Cuaray in eastern
Valencia county.</p>

<p class='c015'>A peculiarly interesting class of ruins is that of the pueblo villages
that were occupied at the time of the coming of the Spaniards and
abandoned during the next century. Archæological work in such sites
should yield valuable results by disclosing the first influences of the exotic
civilization upon the indigenous tribes. Noteworthy sites of this character
are those near Zuñi and a number of the Rio Grande Valley.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Southwest is rich in historic sites, but in prehistoric remains its
wealth is practically limitless. It is with these that we shall deal principally
in this paper.</p>

<p class='c015'>The distribution of the indigenous tribes of America was determined
primarily by drainage; that is to say, the food quest was the chief concern
of primitive man. First of all, he sought food and water, and we can
readily see that, of these two, water was first in importance. Where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>water was, there food was likely to be. Game frequented water courses.
Plant food depended upon moisture. Now in the southwest, water was
scarce, consequently no other portion of the United States was so poor
in game. Hunting tribes, therefore, shunned its desert wastes. Their
frontiers were the Pecos valley in eastern New Mexico, practically the
western limit of the buffalo, and the divide running east and west across
southern Colorado and Utah, separating the San Juan, south of which
lay the arid region, from the splendid hunting ranges on the north which
extended from ocean to ocean except where broken by the Utah and
Nevada deserts. There was thus a tract of country bounded on the east
by the Pecos river, on the north by the San Juan, extending west to the
Colorado and south to the Gila in which aridity was the dominant climatic
condition. Being poor in game, it was not until comparatively recent
times that it was much frequented by nomadic Indians. Comanches, Utes,
Navajos and Apaches had no use for this region until it was occupied by
some one whom they could dispossess of wealth. Primitive economic
systems are not unlike those of civilized men. In both states of culture,
wealth is acquired in two ways, namely, by producing it and by dispossessing
others of it. Savages and civilians naturally divide into two great
classes, the productive and the predatory. It is a far cry from the murderously
straightforward method of the Apache to the highly specialized
up-to-date commercial system, or even the comparatively direct methods
of modern politics, but the difference is merely in technique. Now in the
absence of game and of victims for robbery, the first settlers of that arid
region were driven to produce their living by agriculture. This could
only be successfully done by irrigation. Accordingly lines of migration
followed water ways and springs. Moreover, this condition was conducive
to a comparatively sedentary life, and this leads to permanent
home building.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now the region under consideration embraces all of New Mexico
and Arizona, southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah, and is comprised
within four principal drainage areas, viz: the Rio Grande, the San
Juan, the Little Colorado, and the Gila, the last three being tributary to
the Colorado. Over this area physiographic conditions are quite uniform
and the indigenous tribes now inhabiting it likewise; not as to linguistic
stock, but in general and specific culture. By indigines I mean the various
sedentary tribes generally called Pueblos as distinguished from the intrusive
Utes, Navajos and Apaches, which tribes cames in chiefly for predatory
reasons after the indigenous tribes had acquired sufficient property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>to make them desirable prey. This indigenous culture was doubtless
composite as to blood and the uniformity developed was the natural result
of living for a long period of time under definite uniform environmental
conditions. Its primary migration movement was from south to north,
but branching in all directions, and the almost countless prehistoric ruins
following the water-courses of the southwest are the remains of these
early migrations.</p>

<p class='c015'>The present sedentary Indians of the southwest, called by us Pueblos,
are thus the true indigines of that arid region so far as we can judge from
existing evidences. All presumption of earlier or different races is purely
hypothetical, as yet unsupported by any shadow of evidence. These
primitive agriculturists became builders of more or less permanent houses,
dependent always upon the permanence of the water supply. The character
of their habitations was usually determined by geological environment.
The characteristic style of architecture evolved was the multiple-chambered
stone structure that we call the <i>pueblo</i>. The earliest of these
were comparatively small, single-storied dwellings of an indefinite number
of rooms rarely exceeding fifty, scattered about over the arable areas.
The ruins of these to be found in the southwest are quite uncountable.
Later, as predatory neighbors multiplied and the people crowded together
for mutual aid the enormous hives of hundreds of cells came into existence.
These were often carried to a height of five or six stories. At the
same time and for the same reason another style of habitation came into
existence, namely, the cliff-dwelling. Its type was always determined by
geological conditions. If ledges difficult of access and protected by overhanging
cliffs could be found, dwellings were built upon them, not differing
structurally from pueblos. If the cliffs presented only perpendicular
faces, and were of comparatively soft material, dwellings were excavated
in them, single or multiple-chambered, and thus strongly defensive homes
established.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus we have in the southwest a most fortunate situation for the
archæologist. The ruins are of such a character and so situated as to
resist the action of the weather, and the climate singularly adapted to the
preservation of not only the buildings, but also the more perishable
remains. So completely did the indigenous culture overspread the area
in question that there is not a waterway of any consequence from the
Pecos to the Colorado and from the San Juan to the Gila that is without
numerous ruins. They are distributed along not less than a hundred
valleys in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. In a paper and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>map prepared recently for the use of the Department of the Interior, I
have indicated the distribution of the ruins over the four general drainage-areas,
the Rio Grande, the San Juan, the Little Colorado, the Gila, and
as a tentative scheme have shown how they may be grouped into twenty
archæological districts. (This grouping has no ethnological significance.)</p>

<p class='c015'>The districts are grouped as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I. The Rio Grande Basin:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1. Pajarito Park district.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>2. Pecos Pueblo district.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>3. Gran Quivira district.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>4. Jemez district.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>5. Acoma district.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>II. The San Juan Basin:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1. Aztec district.</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>IV. The Gila Basin:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>1. Rio Verde district.</div>

      <div class='line in4'>5. Upper Gila district.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>6. San Francisco River district.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Following is a brief memorandum showing the extent of each
district:</p>

<h3 class='c023'>I. RIO GRANDE BASIN.</h3>

<p class='c021'>This culture area, lying wholly in New Mexico, embraces the
Rio Grande Valley with its tributaries from Ojo Caliente on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>north to Socorro on the south and from Acoma on the west to the
plains east of the Manzano Mountains.</p>

<h3 class='c023'>II. SAN JUAN BASIN.</h3>

<p class='c021'>The ruins of the San Juan Basin consist of both large and small
communal houses and true cliff dwellings in great numbers. They
are scattered in numerous, irregular groups over the contiguous portions
of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona. All the ruins
of the San Juan and its tributaries have suffered much from destructive
collectors.</p>

<h3 class='c023'>III. LITTLE COLORADO BASIN.</h3>

<p class='c021'>This extensive region embraced in the valley of the Little
Colorado and its tributaries is pre-eminently a region of pueblo ruins,
though some cave dwellings are found. It is especially rich in prehistoric
pottery. Because of its wealth of relics this region has
suffered more than any other from the traffic in prehistoric wares.
However, we are fortunate in that Dr. J. Walter Fewkes of the
Bureau of American Ethnology has made the districts of the Little
Colorado a subject of research for many years. His voluminous
reports on this region have put us in possession of a vast amount of
information on the archæology and ethnology of the Southwest.
His collections from Sikyatki for the National Museum, made in
1895, with the assistance of Mr. F. W. Hodge of the Smithsonian
Institution, together with the collections made from the Holbrook
district by Doctors Fewkes and Hough, form, probably, the most
valuable collection of prehistoric pottery in existence. Another
extensive collection of pottery from this region may be seen in the
Field Columbian Museum in Chicago.</p>

<h3 class='c023'>IV. GILA BASIN.</h3>

<p class='c021'>This is another region that embraces practically every species of
prehistoric ruins. It is of vast extent and comprises, besides the
valley of the Gila proper, the large valleys of the Salt and Verde
rivers. As a seat of prehistoric culture it was one of the most extensive
and populous. Many ruins of these three great valleys are on
irrigable lands, and, accordingly, have disappeared with the advancement
of agriculture.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>It would not be possible within the limits set for this paper to
describe the ruins of each of these twenty districts, but we may point out
briefly the principal features of one district in each drainage area.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>1. PAJARITO PARK DISTRICT.</h4>

<p class='c024'>This district lies between the Rio Grande on the east and the
Jemez Mountains on the west, and extends from Ojo Caliente on the
north to Cochiti on the south. In the northern part are the ruins of
Homayo, Houiri (Ho-we-re), and Pose on Ojo Caliente Creek.
Ten miles west, below El Rito, is the large ruin of Sepawi (Se-paw-we).
Near the village of Abiquiu, on the Rio Chama, is the important
ruin of Tsiwari (Tsi-wa-re). These are all pueblo ruins, and
not well preserved.</p>

<p class='c017'>The central portion of the district is the Pajarito Park proper,
the region that has for some years been under withdrawal by the
General Land Office and favorably reported on for a national park,
for which it has many advantages, being of great scenic beauty,
accessible, and one of the richest in the Southwest in well-preserved
prehistoric remains. It contains innumerable cavate houses, a vast
number of small pueblo ruins, and the ruins of the great communal
dwellings of Puye, Otowi, Tsankiwi (Tsan-ke-we), Navakwi (Nav-a-kwe),
and Pajarito or Tchrega. Vandalism has greatly diminished
among these ruins since the park has been under withdrawal.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the southern part of this district, between the Rito de los Frijoles
and Cochiti, are the ruins of six pueblos, and a considerable
number of cavate houses, the interesting Cueva Pintada (painted
cave), and the famous shrines known as the “Stone Lions of Potrero
de las Vacas and Potrero de los Idolos.”</p>

<h4 class='c013'>2. MESA VERDE DISTRICT.</h4>

<p class='c024'>In this district are the finest specimens of true cliff dwellings.
They are very numerous in the cañons of Mesa Verde and along the
Mancos River. Cliff Palace is justly one of the most famous works
of prehistoric man in existence. Numerous pueblo and cliff ruins are
distributed along the McElmo, the Yellowjacket and the Hovenweep.
On the whole, this is one of the most interesting of all prehistoric
districts. A portion of it is under withdrawal by the General
Land Office, pending the creation of the Colorado Cliff Dwellings
National Park. The intelligent interest of the people of Colorado
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>has done much toward the preservation of these ruins. However,
the entire district has suffered much from vandalism, a majority of
the burial mounds having been destroyed. A national park in this
region would be of great educational value.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>3. ZUÑI DISTRICT.</h4>

<p class='c024'>This region is rich in both historic and prehistoric ruins. On
Zuñi Reservation are the ruins of the historic seven cities of Cibola.
El Morro, or Inscription Rock, is an interesting historic monument
east of Zuñi which is under temporary withdrawal by the General
Land Office. The region south of Zuñi to Quemado is known to be
full of ruins, and traders are securing large collections of pottery
therefrom at the present time. The ruins of Zuñi have been
thoroughly made known to us through the work of the Hemenway
expedition, under the direction of the late Frank Hamilton Cushing,
assisted by Mr. F. W Hodge. The collections of this expedition
are now in the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. Other
important researches have been made in the Zuñi district by Doctor
Fewkes.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>4. RIO VERDE DISTRICT.</h4>

<p class='c024'>On the northern tributaries of the Rio Verde are many cliff
ruins. Of these, Honanki and Palatki are the most important.
They are within the limits of the San Francisco Mountains Forest
Reserve. There are numerous cliff ruins along Oak Creek and
Beaver Creek and their tributaries. Near Camp Verde is the ruin
known as “Montezuma Castle,” and a little farther up Beaver
Creek, on the Black Mesa Forest Reserve, is the interesting Montezuma
well. Mr. Mindeleff and Doctor Fewkes have made important
studies and reports on the ruins of this district.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fortunately not less than nine-tenths of the prehistoric ruins of the
Southwest are on lands owned or controlled by the Government of the
United States; that is, they are on Forest Reserves, on unreserved public
lands and on Indian Reservations.</p>

<p class='c015'>By virtue of Section 441, U. S. Revised Statutes, the care and custody
of the public lands is vested in the Secretary of the Interior, and
Section 453 declares that the Commissioner of the General Land Office
shall perform under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior all
executive duties in anywise respecting such lands. There can be no question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>that this statute lays upon the Department of the Interior and the
General Land Office the obligation to protect the archæological remains
that are upon the public lands as definitely as it does the timber and other
values.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the exercise of the power thus conferred a policy has grown up in
the Department of the Interior that should be more widely understood.
This policy mobilizes, so to speak, the entire force of forest supervisors,
rangers, special agents, Indian school superintendents and teachers, Indian
agents, farmers and police, and even the Indians themselves, in the protection
of these ruins as one of their regular duties, for the avowed purpose
of preserving them for scientific investigation. It establishes the liberal
policy that any competent scientist who desires to place the material
secured in a public museum will be authorized by the Department of the
Interior to examine ruins, but that no person will be permitted to excavate
them for the purpose of acquiring specimens for traffic or private gain,
and that wilful destruction of historic and prehistoric landmarks must
cease. The most zealous archæologist must admit that this leaves little
to be desired. The main thing, a system of governmental protection for
archæological remains, is an accomplished fact. All the available forces
of the Department are being wisely utilized. The scientific branch of the
Government is lending its aid by furnishing as called upon the needed
information concerning sites that are of value to science. Especially
noteworthy is the emphasis habitually laid by the Commissioner of the
General Land Office on “<i>the importance of furthering in every way possible
researches with a view to increasing the knowledge of such objects and
aiding in the general advancement of archæological science</i>.” This is
administrative policy that every scientific man can uphold with most
cordial enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c015'>Let us now consider the question of legislation relative to archæological
remains. Three bills touching this subject will receive attention at
the hands of the present Congress. Two of these are bills for the creation
of national parks. One embraces the famous pueblo-like cliff dwellings
of Mesa Verde, Colorado; the other includes the great district of pueblo
ruins and excavated cliff dwellings known as Pajarito Park near Santa Fe,
New Mexico. These bills are worthy of the strongest support, not only
from the standpoint of historic and scenic preservation, but because of the
educational value of the opening up of these interesting districts to the
traveling public. Both bills are thoughtfully prepared, provide for the
preservation and care of the ruins, and that, with the permission of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>Secretary of the Interior, excavations may be conducted by properly qualified
persons in the interests of science. These are districts of magnificent
scenery, embracing less than two townships each, of non-mineral,
non-agricultural lands. No rights whatever will be encroached upon,
not a settler disturbed. I know of no reason whatever for opposition to
either of these bills. They have the support of the people of Colorado
and New Mexico, and their passage is urged by the Department of the
Interior, the General Land Office having officially examined and favorably
recommended both districts for the purposes specified.</p>

<p class='c015'>The other bill referred to is of much greater importance since it is
a general measure touching not only the preservation of archæological
remains but affecting the whole field of archæological research. Such
bills should receive the most critical scrutiny of those who are engaged in
archæological work and know the field. This bill was introduced at
the last session of Congress as H. R. 13478 by Congressman John F.
Lacey of Iowa. The bill originated in the Department of the Interior.
It grows out of the practical experience of the General Land Office in
dealing with this subject. It is based on a knowledge of the situation and
all the administrative problems involved. It is technically well drawn
and exactly along the broad commendable lines of the policy of the department
as above set forth. It is in fact an outgrowth of the operation
of that policy, the crystalization of which into legislative enactment is now
prayed for. Through repeated official declarations and acts we know
in what manner the powers conferred in the bill will be administered.
The reasons for desiring this enactment are set forth in the Annual Report
of the Commissioner of the General Land Office for 1904. Since it is
clear that the measure has for its motive the advancement of archæological
science and since it emanates from the department that has learned the
necessities of the case by long experience and will be charged with its
administration, it manifestly should receive the support of the scientific
forces unless on examination it is found inadequate. It has been widely
published and is the only bill that has been drawn for the purpose that has
not met with pronounced objections. I trust that this Society<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c019'><sup>[47]</sup></a> will give
serious consideration to the measure and, if it meets with your approval,
send at the proper time a strong expression of that approval to the
National Congress.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c018'>So much public interest has been aroused in the United States by the
discovery of the body of John Paul Jones in Paris, and so many
misleading and confusing statements have been published about
his career that it is desirable to understand just what was the part he
played in the naval struggle for independence, and what is the value of
his services as compared with those rendered by his compatriots on the
high seas. Jones, unquestionably, stood head and shoulders over his
brother officers in the service of the Revolution; yet there were some who
pressed him rather closely in the award of honors concerning whose deeds
comparatively little is known.</p>

<p class='c025'>[It was our hope to have printed an account of the finding of John Paul
Jones’ body, written by General Horace Porter, but the General wrote us from Paris
May 22:</p>

<p class='c016'>“I knew very well Mrs. Lamb’s Magazine, and would be very happy to be
a contributor to yours, but am so pressed by the winding up of my duties here,
and the finishing of the translations of French experts and scientists, etc., on the Paul
Jones matter, that I really have not a moment I can call my own. Assuring you of
my appreciation of the interest you have manifested in the subject, and regretting
very much that I cannot answer you more favorably.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>Horace Porter</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We have, however, much pleasure in quoting from the New York <cite>Evening
Post</cite> the article by Edgar Stanton Maclay.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c027'>Captain Jones was a prolific chronicler of his own doings and left
invaluable records of his truly brilliant achievements. This is mentioned
not in the least to detract from the credit so justly due him (for it is the
more to his honor that, in the rough-and-tumble calling he espoused, he
found time to cultivate one of the “polite arts,” then generally deemed
unnecessary in his profession), but to explain why it is that so little is
known of what his brother captains accomplished in the same period.
Our navy officers of the Revolution were bred, as a rule, in the hard
school of experience, and, to most of them, the task of writing was about
as distasteful as taking a dose of unpalatable medicine. The result has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>been that, while the world for one hundred and twenty-five years has
been fully informed of the superb heroism of John Paul Jones, it
has been kept in comparative ignorance of what his contemporaries
accomplished.</p>

<p class='c015'>This is regrettable for more reasons than one, chief among which
is that, while Jones will be found to have suffered nothing by the comparison,
these humbler heroes of his day have not received the recognition
so justly due them. Of the twenty-nine officers who held the rank of
naval captain in our service during the Revolution, only a few emerged
from obscurity. They, like the great majority in all services, were
destined to perform that hardest of all professional work, the monotonous
routine duty incident to the carrying on of naval war.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were a few, however, who had the good fortune to emerge
from the oblivion of naval drudgery, and, perhaps, the greatest of these
is Nicholas Biddle, of good Pennsylvania stock. He commanded the
<i>Andrea Doria</i> in the first naval expedition of the war, Captain Jones (then
a lieutenant) serving in the same squadron aboard the flagship <i>Alfred</i>.
Jones shortly afterward won the immortal distinction of taking the
<i>Serapis</i> while his own ship went down.</p>

<p class='c015'>A year before the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>-<i>Serapis</i> fight, Biddle had the
unique distinction of both “going up” and “going down” in his ship,
the thirty-two gun frigate <i>Randolph</i>, in her engagement with the ship-of-the-line
<i>Yarmouth</i>. Jones’ bravery of Flamborough Head was
superb, but it does not equal the patriotism and noble sacrifice of Biddle,
who, in order to save his convoy of seven rich merchantmen laden with
goods indispensable to the American cause, unhesitatingly ran alongside
the monster ship-of-the-line and was blown up, 311 of the <i>Randolph’s</i>
complement of 315 perishing, including Biddle—but the convoy was
saved. This was the noblest act of self-sacrifice on a large scale, in the
annals of the American navy. Earlier in the war Biddle, while in command
of the <i>Andrea Doria</i>, in a cruise of four months captured ten English
vessels, which, with the exception of two, reached port in safety—two
of the prizes containing 400 soldiers of a Highland regiment.</p>

<p class='c015'>While the immortal distinction of being the first man to hoist our
national colors aboard an American warship belongs to Captain Jones,
the by no means small honor of showing the American flag for the first
time on a regularly commissioned American warship in European waters
belongs to Captain Lambert Wickes, who crossed the Atlantic in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>sixteen-gun war brig <i>Reprisal</i>. Lambert made a cruise in the Bay of
Biscay, and in two circuits of Ireland took some twenty prizes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nor should the daring cruises of Captain Gustavus Conyngham in
the <i>Surprise</i> be overlooked. One year before Captain Jones appeared on
the other side of the Atlantic as commander of an American warship,
Conyngham scoured the coast of England and picked up prizes in the
very chops of the English Channel. Our commissioner in Europe, Silas
Deane, wrote:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Conyngham, by his first and second bold expeditions, is become
the terror of all the eastern coast of England and Scotland, and is more
dreaded than Thurot was in the late war.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then there were Captains Thomas Thompson and Elisha Hinman,
who one year before Captain Jones’ appearance in English waters,
executed a dash against a British fleet which is second in audacity only
to Jones’ attack on the British fleet off Spurn Head. On the night of
September 2, 1777, the thirty-two-gun frigate <i>Raleigh</i>, and the twenty-four-gun
ship <i>Alfred</i>, commanded by Captains Thompson and Hinman,
while on their way across the ocean, discovered a fleet of merchantmen,
escorted by four British warships, among them the <i>Druid</i>. Availing himself
of the cover of night, Thompson worked his way into the fleet undetected,
and getting alongside the <i>Druid</i> opened a terrific fire on her so
that in a short time she was reduced to a sinking condition. Realizing
the folly of fighting the combined escort, Thompson then made good his
escape, and arrived safely in France with the <i>Raleigh</i> and <i>Alfred</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nor should the daring of an American privateer be overlooked,
which, very much after the manner of Jones at Whitehaven, sent a force
of men ashore on English soil and made prisoners of a lieutenant and an
adjutant of a British regiment, as the following extract from the private
letter of an English gentleman will show:</p>

<p class='c015'>“An American privateer of twelve guns came into this road
[Guernsey] yesterday morning, tacked about on the firing of guns from
the castle, and, just off the island, took a large brig bound for this port,
which they have since carried into Cherbourg. She had the impudence to
send her boat in the dusk of the evening to a little island off here called
Jetto, and unluckily carried off the lieutenant of Northley’s Independent
Company with the adjutant, who were shooting rabbits for their
diversion.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Not only in English home waters were American naval efforts being
expended with conspicuous advantage to the cause before Jones appeared
on the scene, but in British colonial possessions our hardy mariners created
unprecedented havoc in the enemy’s commerce, which did much to bring
the mother country to terms. An English correspondent writing from
Jamaica under date of May 2, 1777, said that in one week upward of
fourteen English ships were carried into Martinique by American warships.
Another Englishman, writing from Grenada, April 18, 1777,
said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everything continues excessively dear here, and we are happy if we
can get anything for money by reason of the quantity of vessels that are
taken by American privateers. A fleet of vessels came from Ireland a few
days ago. From sixty vessels that departed from Ireland, not above
twenty-five arrived in this and neighboring islands, the others (it is
thought) being all taken by the American privateers. God knows, if this
American war continues much longer, we shall all die of hunger. There
was a Guineaman that came from Africa with 450 negroes, some thousand-weight
of gold dust, and a great many elephant teeth; the whole
cargo being computed to be worth twenty thousand pounds sterling, taken
by an American privateer a few days ago.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Captain Jones’ brilliant career does not suffer by a comparison with
these extraordinary achievements on the high seas. On the contrary, his
record is the more resplendent by the contrast. These incidents are mentioned
only to show that while Jones was the brightest star in the galaxy
of our naval heroes, “there were others” who contributed to the lustre
of American naval renown in the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c015'>Having shown, briefly, the work done by other distinguished sea
fighters in our struggle for independence, we can better estimate the worth
of the truly great achievements of Captain John Paul Jones while in the
service of the United States. They suffer no diminution by having
Captain Jones shorn of the false title of “Admiral.” There have been
only three “Admirals” in the United States navy: Farragut, Porter,
and Dewey. The nearest approach to an admiral in our navy of the
Revolution was the title conferred upon Esek Hopkins, who was made
“commander-in-chief” of our sea forces, a rank intended to correspond
to that held by Washington on land. On the escape of the British warship
<i>Glasgow</i>, in Long Island Sound, 1776, Hopkins was unjustly blamed
for the mishap, and the title of “commander-in-chief of the navy” was
dropped.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Neither is it necessary to call Jones the “father of the American
navy.” If such a title could be properly applied to any one, that person
is John Adams, who, from the beginning, strenuously advocated the need
of a navy, and worked harder than any one man of his time for its establishment
on a permanent basis. The fame of Captain Jones needs none
of these artificial bolsters for its support. It stands on the solid foundation
of personal merit and nothing can add to or detract from it. We
have ample evidence of this in the extraordinary manifestation of popular
interest in the removal of his remains from a foreign soil to a final resting
place in America.</p>

<p class='c015'>What has been said here about the exploits of other naval heroes
in the Revolution is used merely as a foil for the better setting off of the
great central figure of the navy of that period. What Biddle, Wickes,
Conyngham, Thompson, Hinman, and the American privateersmen did
separately, Jones did as one man.</p>

<p class='c015'>After taking as commendable a part as a subordinate could in the
successful expedition to New Providence, he commanded the warship
<i>Providence</i>, and performed some of the most remarkable feats in seamanship
on record, besides inflicting serious losses on the enemy. As commander
of the <i>Alfred</i>, in which he began his American career as lieutenant,
he added to his reputation as a daring and successful skipper. In
the <i>Ranger</i> he cruised in the Irish Sea with a boldness and success that has
never been surpassed, while his extraordinary career in the <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i> stands unsurpassed in the annals of the world’s naval history.
Within the scope of his necessarily limited naval activities, he has set a
standard of professional excellence that present and coming generations
of naval aspirants will find difficult to surpass.</p>

<h3 class='c023'>THE MOONLIGHT BATTLE</h3>

<p class='c028'>We have much pleasure in presenting our subscribers with the first engraving of
Thomas Birch’s painting of John Paul Jones’ greatest sea-fight.</p>

<p class='c016'>It illustrates the desperate encounter at the moment when a hand-grenade has been
dropped from the <i>Bon Homme’s</i> mainyard down a hatchway of the <i>Serapis</i>, causing a
terrible explosion.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the distance can be seen the British merchant vessels, under the protection of the
guns of Scarborough Castle, as also the conflict between the <i>Pallas</i>,—the only other
ship of Jones’ squadron actively engaged,—and the <i>Countess of Scarborough</i>, which also
ended in the defeat of the British vessel.</p>

<p class='c016'>For the use of the plate we are indebted to the kindness of Mr. S. V. Henkels, Philadelphia.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>BURLEIGH—AND JOHNSON’S ISLAND</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c018'>It is safe to surmise that several elderly Americans have watched the
news from Manchuria during the past winter with a half expectation
of reading of some wild adventure on the part of Bennet Burleigh,
correspondent of the London <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>. Among these were Mr.
Justice Brown of the United States Supreme Court, who just forty years
ago secured his extradition from Canada on a nominal charge of robbery,
but really on account of his participation in the Johnson’s Island conspiracy.
Among them also was James Lattimore, once sheriff of Ottawa
County, O., from whose custody he escaped, but who seems to have very
pleasant recollections of his whilom prisoner, in spite of the fact that his
private purse was somewhat depleted in efforts to recover the fugitive
whose society he had found so agreeable that he had been in the habit of
taking him about the village of Port Clinton with him. There may be
living in Texas some of Burleigh’s journalistic associates prepared for
almost any deed of daring on his part. The sketch of his career in
“Who’s Who” reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Burleigh, Bennet, war correspondent, on the staff of the <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite> since 1882; b. Glasgow; married. Fought in American
war (twice sentenced to death); Central News correspondent
throughout first Egyptian war (present at Tel-el-Kebir); correspondent
French campaign Madagascar; as <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> correspondent
accompanied desert column from Korti to Metammah,
1884 (present at Abu Klea, despatches); Ashanti expedition;
Atbara expedition; Egyptian war (present at Omdurman); South
African war, 1899–1902. Address: 95 North Side, Clapham Common,
S. W.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who’s Who” omits mention of several books of which he is the
author—“Desert Warfare,” “Two Campaigns: Madagascar and Ashantee.”
“Khartoum Campaign, 1898; or the Reconquest of the Soudan,”
“Sirdar and Khalifa,” and “Natal Campaign.” In <cite>Harper’s Magazine</cite>
for July, 1900, Fred A. McKenzie says that for Burleigh to spend a
day in battle and then ride sixty miles, afterwards write a long and
brilliant dispatch and get it first through, is a trifle. He also says Burleigh
is an ardent Socialist and has several times been a labor candidate
for Parliament in Glasgow, that his favorite drink is soda-water, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>he abjures tobacco. He adds: “When every outlet from the Transvaal
was closed, he boarded the train of the Boer General Joubert and
traveled with him, securing a long interview with him and full details
of the Boer intentions. He so won Joubert that the old general lent
him a conveyance to go over into British territory.” But, as the country
editor said of another brilliant newspaper correspondent, “Alas, not for
him the glittering hatchet, not for him the fruitful cherry tree.” It is
not true that Burleigh, or as he was then called, Bennet G. Burley, was
twice sentenced to death during the American Civil War, though it might
be said that twice he stood in some danger of being hanged by the
Federals, into whose hands he had fallen and against whom he
had waged irregular warfare. And both times he succeeded in escaping
from custody.</p>

<p class='c015'>Judge Daniel B. Lucas of Charlestown, W. Va., in his anonymously
published “Memoir of John Yates Beall,” says Burley was the son of
a Glasgow master mechanic and that when he first appeared in Richmond
he had in his pocket the plan of a submarine battery invented by his
father. He had also a plan for a torpedo that could be attached to
the side of a vessel by screws and then ignited with a fuse. Judge
Lucas asserts that Burley actually assisted one John Maxwell to fasten
such a torpedo to a Union war vessel, but the fuse refused to ignite, no
damage was done, and the torpedo found its way to New York, where it
was exhibited at the corner of Fulton and Nassau streets. At a later date
a Northern newspaper printed a story that before coming to America
Burley had fought in Italy both with the Garibaldians and against them:
but whether this be true or not, there is no question that he was engaged
with Beall in certain small privateering enterprises in the waters of
Eastern Virginia, or that he took part in a raid across Chesapeake Bay
under Capt. Thad Fitzhugh in March, 1864, when the raiders captured
the steam tug <i>Titan</i> and destroyed another vessel. May 12, Burley
was himself wounded and captured near the mouth of the Rappahannock
River by a skirmish guard of the 36th United States Colored Infantry,
and he had to surrender to black men, for no officers came up until
the fighting was over. On his person were found papers authorizing
him to go beyond the Confederate lines, and it was suspected that he had
on foot some adventure as a spy. He was taken to Fort Delaware, forty
miles below Philadelphia, whence he and five others attempted their
escape through a sewer, the water in which came up to the log sleepers
supporting the plank cover. The fugitives had to make their way for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>distance of about twenty-five yards along this sewer, diving under each
sleeper as they came to it, and upon reaching its mouth to swim the
Delaware River for a distance of a mile and a half, with a tide running
that more than doubled the effort necessary to cover the distance. Two
of them were captured at the mouth of the sewer, and two were drowned
in the river, but Burley and a companion, thanks to the Scotchman’s extraordinary
physical powers, got away safely, being picked up in mid river
by a vessel whose master professed to accept their story that they had
been upset while on a fishing excursion, and took them to Philadelphia.
Burley thence made his way to Canada, and in Toronto he fell in with his
old associate in Eastern Virginia, John Y. Beall. Judge Lucas, who narrates
these adventures, probably got his account of them from Burley
himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>Unlike the other Great Lake cities, Sandusky, O., lies not on a
narrow creek, but upon the shore of a broad bay which encloses Johnson’s
Island, about 300 acres in extent. The island and the surrounding
waters present a very pleasing aspect, and the Sandusky people are grievously
disappointed that this site was not selected for the Great Lake
naval training station by the board which recently decided upon a point
on Lake Michigan. It is worth noting that the convincing objection to
any site on Lake Erie, its ease of access from a foreign and possibly
hostile country, was the very cause of much official anxiety at the only
time Johnson’s Island was used for a national purpose. For in October,
1861, the Government established here a dépôt for captured Confederate
officers, whose numbers after the surrender of Vicksburg and Port Hudson
ran up to between two and three thousand. They were confined
within a stockade enclosing an area of fifteen acres, being housed in
thirteen two-story barracks and guarded by two blockhouses, one at a
corner of the palisade and one at the gate, so situated that it looked down
the street between the two rows of barracks. One of these blockhouses,
with the prison cemetery and the ruins of two earth forts, now forms
the only relic of the island’s occupation by the Confederates. The cemetery
contains 206 uniform marble slabs erected after the war by the
Southern people. The whole number of Confederates buried here was
about 230, five at least of whom were executed by the Federal authorities
for atrocious treatment of Southern Unionists, enlisting troops within
the Federal lines, and similar offenses. The graves on the island have for
years been regularly decorated with flowers by the Sandusky Grand Army
men when they were paying the same tribute to the memory of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>comrades buried on the mainland, and they have even been subjected to
some criticism for this display of magnanimity. One sometimes sees
statements that none of the prisoners ever succeeded in escaping from
Johnson’s Island, but in the Burley extradition proceedings Capt. Robert
C. Kennedy, who was afterwards hanged for his part in the plot to burn
New York, swore that he had effected such an escape.</p>

<p class='c015'>Almost from the establishment of this dépôt for prisoners of war
there were rumors of threatened attacks upon it by Confederates from
Canada, though the first actual plan for a Rebel raid on the Great Lakes
of which we have any official evidence, seems to have been directed
primarily against the <i>Michigan</i>, the only Union war vessel in these waters,
while she still lay at Erie. In February, 1863, Lieut. William Murdaugh,
of the Confederate navy, laid before his superiors a plan for
capturing the <i>Michigan</i> and destroying the lake cities. He proposed,
with a small steamer and fifty men armed with cutlasses, revolvers, and
small iron buoys to be used as torpedoes, to surprise and capture the
Union vessel by boarding and then, before news of the affair had reached
the Canadians, to send the smaller vessel back through the Welland
Canal, to work destruction along the New York shore of Lake Ontario,
and especially to the Erie Canal aqueduct at Rochester, while he himself
proceeded, in the <i>Michigan</i>, to treat in a similar fashion the locks and shipping
at Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, Milwaukee, and the Sault Ste.
Marie, finally running the <i>Michigan</i> ashore in Georgian Bay and
destroying her. The Confederate Cabinet approved of the scheme and
set aside $100,000 for its consummation, but Murdaugh says that when
everything was ready for a start Jefferson Davis, while deeming the
enterprise practicable, caused it to be laid aside for a time, lest such a
storm should be aroused over the violation of the British neutrality laws
as to put a stop to the building of Confederate ironclads then on the
stocks in England. Just six months later Secretaries Seddon and Mallory
suggested to Lieut. R. D. Minor, also of the Confederate navy, a
similar undertaking having for its main purpose the release of the Confederates
confined at Sandusky. The proposition was eagerly embraced,
and a party of twenty-two naval officers, who undertook to carry it out,
reached Montreal about October 21 and announced to the Johnson’s
Island prisoners, through the personal column of the New York <cite>Herald</cite>,
that “a carriage would be at the door a few nights after the fourth of
November.” The original plan contemplated taking passage on a lake
steamer at Windsor, opposite Detroit, and seizing her when fairly out on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Lake Erie. The prisoners were expected to overcome their rather scanty
guard, and their rescuers were simply to receive them on board for transportation
to Canada. But on learning that the lake steamers seldom
and at irregular intervals stopped at any Canadian port, and possibly
because the conspirators had ascertained that the <i>Michigan</i> now lay in
front of the prison, a different method was adopted. Passage was to be
taken at St. Catherines on one of a line of steamers running from Ogdensburg
to Chicago, for the party, as mechanics and laborers who were to be
employed on the waterworks of the latter city. With numbers increased
to fifty-four from escaped prisoners found in Canada, the conspirators
assembled at St. Catherines armed with revolvers, butcher knives, and
two small nine-pounders, a store of dumb-bells having been laid in to serve
as cannon balls. A private named Conelly went to Ogdensburg and paid
the passage money for twenty-five men, with an agreement that as many
more laborers should be taken as he could secure. The weapons were to
be boxed up and marked “Machinery,” and the plan was, after seizing
the vessel, to arrive at Sandusky about daylight, come into collision with
the <i>Michigan</i> as if by accident, board and carry her, turn her guns on the
prison headquarters, and demand the surrender of the island, the reputation
for humanity of the commander, Col. William S. Pierson, being one
of the factors relied on for the success of the plot. The Confederate prisoners
were to be taken to Canada by some of the steamers lying at Sandusky,
while the <i>Michigan</i>, her crew reinforced by some fifty rebel officers
from the island, was to lay waste the shore of Lake Erie, paying especial
attention to Buffalo. But on November 11, Lord Monck, Governor-General
of Canada, warned the Washington authorities of the plot, at the
same time taking precautions to prevent its execution. Two days before,
the military officials at Detroit had sent word that an attack was to be made
on the prison, and the guard had been considerably strengthened; but Lord
Monck’s message caused general alarm among the lake cities. While
Gen. Jacob D. Cox was fortifying Cedar Point, at the entrance of Sandusky
Bay, Gen. Dix was recommending the removal of the prisoners
from Johnson’s Island, so greatly was he disturbed over the undefended
condition of Buffalo, whither he had hurried. A month later Gen. Halleck
expressed the belief that there was “no real foundation for the pretended
raid,” but the foregoing story of the preparations is taken from a
letter to Admiral Buchanan from Lieut. Minor, who attributes the failure
of the enterprise wholly to its betrayal to Lord Monck, which he charges
to one McCuaig, a Canadian sympathizer with the South.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The connection is not clear between the inchoate Murdaugh-Minor
plot of 1863, and the actual Beall-Burley-Cole attempt of 1864. But
the advent in Canada, as a Confederate emissary, of Jacob Thompson,
President Buchanan’s Secretary of the Navy, probably explains the
revival of the scheme. At any rate Thompson reports to Secretary
Benjamin that he sent Capt. Charles H. Cole around the lakes as a lower
deck passenger to study the various harbors and to learn all he could
about the <i>Michigan</i>, in order to devise some plan for her capture. Cole
had belonged to Forrest’s command, had been taken prisoner, and had
been released on taking an oath of allegiance to the United States. Maj.
Robert Stiles, of Richmond, who had the misfortune to be confined in
the same casemate with Cole at Fort Lafayette at a later date, regards
him as an unmitigated villain and says it was believed that he had
belonged to both the Union and Confederate armies and had deserted
from both, and Judge Lucas, whom he once visited, entertains an almost
equally unfavorable opinion of the man who now established himself in
Sandusky and, professing to be engaged in the oil business, proceeded to
cultivate acquaintance with military and naval officers, his tactics being
based chiefly on the hypothesis that they suffered from a perennial and
unconquerable thirst. He was accompanied by a woman whom he sometimes
introduced as his wife, but who was regarded by some of the
<i>Michigan’s</i> officers as a person of doubtful character. Cole did succeed
in establishing terms of intimacy with some army and navy officers, and
in a newspaper article of 1882, purporting to be based on his revelations,
it was asserted that he got two Confederates enlisted on board the
<i>Michigan</i> and ten in the troops guarding the prison; but the article contains
such absurdities as an account of a visit to the <i>Michigan</i> by Jacob
Thompson disguised in petticoats, and is otherwise so palpably fictitious as
to render it practically worthless. There are Sandusky traditions that
he won over some of the vessel’s engineering force, with the result of disabling
her temporarily, but these stories are scouted by the one surviving
officer of the ship, Capt. James Hunter, of Erie, then an acting ensign,
and they do not find the slightest support in the official documents of the
time. The naval officer with whom Cole was most intimate was transferred
to the Atlantic coast before anything happened, on account of
his habits, and Capt. Hunter, whom Cole had tried to induce to leave
the service, remembers his indignation with the conspirator because the
latter criticised this transfer and otherwise presumed upon his acquaintance.
Hunter suspected him of being a counterfeiter.</p>

<p class='c015'>The real leader of the enterprise, John Yates Beall, was the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>of Cole in every respect, being a young man of strong religious convictions
and of serious character throughout. He was a graduate of the
University of Virginia, belonged to an old family in the Shenandoah
Valley, and owned one of the best farms there. Having been wounded
in October, 1861, while serving as a private under Stonewall Jackson,
he had spent some time with a brother in Dubuque County,
Ia., and on the discovery that he was a Confederate had fled to Canada,
thence returning South, and, under a commission as an acting master in
the Confederate navy, embarking in those Chesapeake Bay privateering
enterprises to which reference has been made and in which Burley was
associated with him. His biographer claims for him the original suggestion
of the Lake Erie undertaking, but he is here without support from
the official records. Beall’s operations in Eastern Virginia caused the
Federal authorities so much annoyance that a considerable effort was
made to end them, with the result that he was captured on board a
schooner he had just taken in November, 1863. He and his companions
were detained at Fort McHenry in irons for over a month, with the idea
that they should be regarded as pirates, but Gen. Butler finally ordered
them to be placed on the footing of prisoners of war, and in May, Beall
was exchanged. Returning to Richmond, he participated in the fighting
around Mechanicsville as a volunteer, but a little later left the army, discouraged,
his biographer says, both by the neglect of his superiors and
by the condition of his health. He proceeded by way of Baltimore and
New York to Canada, where on applying to Jacob Thompson for the
command of a privateer on Lake Huron, he was told of a plan to capture
the <i>Michigan</i> and release the Johnson’s Island prisoners, and at once
volunteered his services. His diary says that he also went to Sandusky
and had a consultation there with Cole, returning thence to Windsor,
opposite Detroit, where Thompson made his headquarters, to collect his
men.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sunday evening, September 18, 1864, Burley stepped on board, at
her wharf in Detroit, the small steamer <i>Philo Parsons</i>, which ran between
Detroit and Sandusky. He asked the clerk, Walter O. Ashley, to stop
the next morning at Sandwich, on the Canadian side of the river, to take
on three friends of his, one of whom was lame and could not well
cross the ferry. Ashley consented on condition that Burley should himself
come aboard at Detroit. On Monday morning, accordingly, Burley
was one of the passengers who started with the boat, and at Sandwich
three men, one of whom was Beall, jumped aboard. Later at Amherstburgh,
or Malden, also on the Canadian side, sixteen roughly dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>men, with an old trunk tied with a rope, took passage. They appeared
to have no relations with the Beall and Burley party, and were supposed
to be returning Americans who had run away from the draft. At Middle
Bass Island, which was the home of Capt. Atwood, commanding the
steamer, he went ashore, leaving her in charge of the mate and Ashley,
who was a part owner. After leaving Kelly’s Island, which is about six
miles from the Ohio shore, Beall, who had been talking with the mate at
the wheel, drew a pistol and declared that as a Confederate officer he
took possession of the steamer. At the same time three others leveled
revolvers at Ashley, and Burley ordered him into the cabin, whither the
passengers, some fifty in number, were also driven, a guard being placed
at the door. The old trunk was opened, and proved to contain hatchets
and revolvers, with which the captors of the boat armed themselves.
Burley proceeded to smash a trotting sulky that stood on deck and throw
overboard the pieces, together with the rest of the deck load, consisting
of iron, household goods, and tobacco. He and Beall then took the clerk
to his office and compelled him to give up the steamer’s papers, later in
the day taking also what money he had, amounting to some $90. These
events occurred between four and five o’clock in the afternoon, and the
boat had run down the lake to a point from which, as the mate, Dewitt
C. Nicholls, afterwards testified, the <i>Michigan</i> was plainly visible in
Sandusky Bay. He was asked many questions about her, and when it
was learned from him that the <i>Parsons</i> had not enough fuel to take her
much farther, he was ordered to turn her about and head for Middle
Bass Island, where wood could be taken on board. While she was still
lying at the wharf there, the <i>Island Queen</i>, a smaller boat which plied
between this group of islands and Sandusky, came up, having on board
about twenty-five unarmed Union soldiers, who were on their way to
Toledo to be mustered out. As she unsuspiciously moored alongside,
some of Beall’s men jumped on board and took possession. A dozen
pistols were fired, and the engineer of the <i>Queen</i> was shot in the face,
but not seriously injured. Gen. Dix, who made an official report on the
whole affair, says that several persons were knocked down and that some
injuries were suffered from blows with hatchets, one of which caused a
profuse loss of blood, but this was the limit of personal suffering inflicted
by the raiders. The passengers of both boats, after some detention in
the cabin and hold of the <i>Parsons</i>, were put ashore on the island, as were
most of the two crews, a few men being retained on the <i>Parsons</i> to handle
her. The soldiers were paroled not to bear arms against the Confederacy
until regularly exchanged, and the civilians were required to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>promise that they would say nothing of what had happened for twenty-four
hours. Then the two steamers, lashed abreast, got under way, but
after going about five miles, the <i>Queen</i> was scuttled and set adrift, after
wards sinking on Chickanolee Reef. The <i>Parsons</i> continued on her way
toward Sandusky for a time, but owing to a failure to receive at Kelly’s
Island a messenger from Cole, all the party except Beall, Burley, and two
others, weakened at the prospect of attacking the <i>Michigan</i> with hatchets
and revolvers. Beall regarded their prudence as mutiny, and required
from them a written statement, which was drawn up on the back of a
bill of lading and can be found with the names of the signers in Capt.
T. T. Hines’s account of the affair in vol. 2 of the <cite>Southern Bivouac</cite>.
With great reluctance on the part of Beall, the boat’s head was turned
toward the Detroit River, and the residents of Middle Bass, who were
out burying their valuables, saw her steaming by in the darkness, “like
a scared pickerel.” On the way a Confederate flag was hoisted, the
mate, Nicholls, being required to assist in the unpleasant task of getting
it up, and there was some talk of attacking a vessel or two that were
passed and of robbing the island home of a Detroit banker named Ives.
A boat load of plunder was landed near Malden, and at Sandwich the
<i>Parsons</i> was abandoned, some of her furniture being put ashore and her
injection pipes being cut, so that she would fill and sink. The raiders
then disappeared, a couple of them who were later arrested by the Canadian
authorities being discharged by a justice of the peace after a detention
of two hours.</p>

<p class='c015'>Beall’s plan of attack on the <i>Michigan</i> is not intelligible. Cole
intended to have some of her officers ashore that evening participating
in a revel, and perhaps there was some basis for the later talk of drugged
wine to be sent aboard. Captain Hunter remembers two occasions when
Cole did send wine to the officers. The prisoners knew some scheme for
their release was on foot, for Archibald S. McKennon, of South McAlester,
I. T., the present counsel for the Seminole Nation, who was then
on the island, tells the writer: “We were organized into companies
and regiments and had armed ourselves with clubs, which were made of
stovewood and other material at hand, with which to make the fight. I
think I was a captain of the organization. Anyhow, I occupied some
position by which I had information of the contemplated movement, for
I remember I had several conferences with the colonel of the organization
as to my duties, and we were in constant expectation of orders to
make the fight, which never came. It surely would have been a pitiable
affair, for the undertaking was wholly impracticable.” Capt. Hunter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>has an ingenious theory that Beall intended that just as the <i>Parsons</i>
entered the Bay, she should burst into flames, and when the <i>Michigan</i>
sent her boats to rescue the passengers, the conspirators could get possession
of these and with them gain the deck of the warship without arousing
suspicion. Gen. Dix did find on the <i>Parsons</i> some combustible material,
but he was probably right in supposing that it had been prepared for the
purpose of burning Banker Ives’s house or the <i>Parsons</i> when she was
abandoned. It looks as if Beall was trusting largely to luck, which, as
the case turned out, was overwhelmingly against him. For on Saturday,
two days before he boarded the <i>Parsons</i>, a man professing to be a Confederate
refugee in Canada called at the military headquarters in Detroit
and gave such information that the following telegram was sent to the
<i>Michigan’s</i> commander:</p>

<h3 class='c013'>LETTER OF ROBERT STUART, INDIAN AGENT, TO JOHN C. SPENCER,</h3>
<p class='c021'>SECRETARY OF WAR.</p>

<p class='c029'>[Secretary Spencer was the father of the unfortunate Midshipman Philip Spencer, of the
brig <i>Somers</i>, who was hanged for mutiny by the orders of Captain Mackenzie. The letter is
about incursions of Canadian halfbreeds. The endorsement is by General Winfield Scott, then
Commander of the Army. It is interesting as referring to the now almost extinct buffalo, then
found in enormous herds, and as showing the widely scattered posts of the “Old Army,” and
their various duties. General Scott’s endorsement is in a hand as minute as he himself was
large.]</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>I have the honor to communicate in writing, the substance of the
verbal information I gave you some time since, relative to the annual
hunting expeditions which are made by the British half breeds of Red
River, into the territory of the United States. These keen &#38; expert
hunters usually leave the colony in the month of June, after having made
the necessary preparations for curing the meat of the large numbers of
Buffalo which they annually slaughter. Their route is in the direction of
Devil’s Lake, &#38; thence diagonally across towards the Missouri River, the
very region which abounds with Buffalo. From the information which
I have received on this point 15 to 20,000 of these animals are destroyed
annually by them. They also each Fall, divide into small parties and
carry off much valuable furs. The bands of Sioux Indians, who are the
possessors of this region are conciliated by presents of Liquor, &#38;c.—and
do not consequently attempt to molest them, nor would it be easy to
prevent these incursions, if the Indians were so disposed; for the halfbreeds
usually number 300 or 400 men, well armed &#38; united under a
species of discipline.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c015'>If measures were taken to put a stop to these expeditions, the Hudson
Bay Company would be cut off from their supplies of pimegan
(pemmican—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>) (dried and pounded Buffalo meat) upon which they
rely much for subsistence; and the halfbreeds, deprived of a lucrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>trade, would soon be compelled to separate into smaller bands, and remove
farther into the North. Ohio &#38; Michigan would then be resorted to by
the agents of the Co. to obtain provisions, and the States would be so far
benefitted in furnishing supplies, in lieu of those of which our own Indians
&#38; Traders are now so improperly deprived.</p>

<p class='c015'>The halfbreeds of the North are for the most part a fierce &#38; turbulent
race, impatient of control, &#38; so much feared by the Hudson Bay
Co. that they are said to keep in pay some of their leading men, with a
view to prevent outbreaks. They are not nearly so numerous as they have
been represented, probably not exceeding 600 to 800 men, in all, and the
white settlers, who numbered 1000 to 2000 a few years since, are mostly
dispersed. I would suggest whether it might not be well to send a force,
not less than 300 to 400 Dragoons, at the proper season, which would at
once overawe both halfbreeds &#38; Indians.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Endorsement</i>: When the 5 troops of the 2d. Dragoons, now in

June) the 1st Dragoons may be concentrated, or nearly so, on the Upper
Missouri, &#38; thus furnish the detachment of two or three troops wanted
for the within purpose. Three troops would be sufficient—Mr. Stuart
does not give the southern limits of the halfbreeds. Feb. 20, 1842.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Postscript</i>: Of the 1st Dragoons, one troop is now at Fort Atkinson
(Nebraska—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>), 6 are at Ft. Leavenworth, &#38; 3 on the Arkansaw. I
still think 3 or 4 troops of horse, say even 150 men, enough.</p>

  <h3 class='c023'>AUTOGRAPH LETTER OF EDGAR ALLAN POE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c030'>[Addressed to his uncle, William Poe, of Augusta, Ga. Dated Philadelphia, August 15,
1840. Valuable for its details of plan of a proposed
new magazine, and his past connection
with others.]</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='sc'>Dear William</span>,</p>

<p class='c015'>Owing to a temporary absence from town I did not receive your
welcome letter of the 28th July until this morning. I now hasten to
reply, and in the first place let me assure you that, if I have not lately
written, it is rather because I have been overwhelmed by worldly cares
which left me scarce a moment for thought, than that I do not feel for
you the kindest affection as well as deep gratitude for the services yourself
and brothers have so often rendered me.</p>

<p class='c015'>Herewith I send you a prospectus of my contemplated Magazine.
I believe you know that my connection with the <cite>Southern Messenger</cite>
was merely that of editor. I had no proprietary in it and my movements
were therefore much impeded. The situation was disagreeable to me in
every respect. The drudgery was excessive, the salary was contemptible.
In fact, I soon found that whatever reputation I might personally gain,
this reputation would be all. I stood no chance of bettering my
pecuniary condition, while my best energies were wasted in the service
of an illiterate and vulgar, although well-meaning man, who had neither
the capacity to appreciate my labors nor the will to reward them. For
this reason I left him and entered first into an engagement with the <cite>New
York Review</cite> and afterwards with the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, writing
occasionally for [both] journals; my object being merely to keep my
head above water as regards money until a good opportunity [should
arrive] of establishing a Magazine of my own in which I should be able
to carry out my plans to full completion and at the same time have the
satisfaction of feeling that my exertions were to my own advantage. I
believe that the plans I here speak of and some of them you will find
detailed in the Prospectus, are well devised and digested, and will meet
with the hearty support of the most desirable and intelligent portion of
the community, should I be able to bring them fairly before the public
I feel assured that my fortune is made. The ambition which actuates
me I know to be no ordinary or unworthy sentiment and knowing this,
I take pride in earnestly soliciting your support, and that of your brothers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>and friends. If I fully succeed in my purpose I shall not fail to produce
some lasting effect upon the growing literature of this country, while I
establish for myself individually a name which that country ‘will not
willingly let die.’...</p>

<p class='c015'>It is upon the South that I chiefly rely for aid in the undertaking,
and I have every hope that it will not fail me in my need. Yet the
difficulties which I have to overcome are great, and I acknowledge to
you that my prospects depend very much upon getting together a subscription
list previously to the first of December. If by this day I can
obtain 500 names, the work cannot fail to proceed, and I have no fears
for the result. The friendship you have always evinced, the near relationship
which exists between us, and the kind offer in your last letter, all
warrant me in hoping that you will exert your whole influence for me in
Augusta. Will you oblige me by acting as my agent for the <cite>Penn
Magazine</cite> in your city, this letter being your authority? If I am not
mistaken, you already act in that capacity for the <cite>Messenger</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>I will write a few lines also by this mail to your brother Robert,
with a Prospectus, as you suggest—and also to Washington [Poe] at
Macon.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Clemm, my aunt, is still living with me, but for the last six
weeks has been on a visit to a friend in the State of N. Jersey. She is
quite well, having entirely recovered her health. Respecting the letter
from Mr. Bayard I am quite at a loss to understand it. It is however
possible that the letter was written by Mr. B. at a period when we were
all in much difficulty in New York and that Mrs. C(lemm) concealed the
circumstance from me through delicacy.</p>

at Zubly’s, to cover the removal of the Corn Meal, &#38;c., under the
Direction of Col Wylley D. Q. M. General. I am sorry to observe that
that Gentleman overtook the Army at Alleston’s on the march, where he
inform’d me that he could not obtain the Ox teams &#38; carts, and doubted
of means to bring the Corn Meal on.—I have sent off Capt. Spencer (of
the Q’r master’s Department) with orders to collect what carriages
[carts] he can on his way to Zubly’s ferry and Directed him to bring off
the Corn Meal if possible so far as Mr. Heyward’s plantation, from
whence it may after be brought to camp. I have posted a strong Picquet
at Port Royal ferry &#38; such other Guards as our safety required &#38; number
would afford. The large Boats at Zubly’s ferry are sunk in a deep
lagoon on the So Car’o. side a little higher up the River—have decided
that the Boat which brought the Corn meal be sunk in like manner.</p>

<p class='c015'>The prisoners are this hour brought by an officer of Col. Garden’s,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Silvanus Wood of Woburn, Mass., on the alarm of the 19th of
April, 1775, left his home at Kendall’s Mill and hastened to Lexington

them. He assisted in removing the dead and wounded from the field to
the meeting-house and then followed the British troops to Concord,
accompanied by a companion who was unarmed. When about a mile
beyond the meeting-house, near Parkhurst’s Hill in Lexington, Wood
observing a British soldier who had left the ranks and was resting by the
roadside, ordered him to surrender, which he did, and taking from him
his musket and equipment gave them to his companion. They then
marched their prisoner to Lexington and delivered him into custody.
Wood later enlisted in the army formed by Washington at Cambridge,
and was at New York and in New Jersey, at the battle of Trenton [and
was wounded at the battle of Pell’s Point (Pelham), Oct. 18, 1776. He
was then an Ensign in Col. Loammi Baldwin’s regiment, the 26th
Massachusetts.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>].</p>

<h3 class='c013'>JOHN PAUL JONES RELICS</h3>

<p class='c021'>There are but three articles in the
National Museum which serve as relics
of the great naval hero of revolutionary
times, whose remains were recently unearthed
in Paris by Ambassador Porter.
The three articles are in a case containing
mementos of the Revolution, and
they consist of an old flag which flew at
the masthead of the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>,
an old flintlock musket, and a fierce-looking
cutlass, both of which were captured
from the <i>Serapis</i> when Jones took
that ship in the famous engagement of
September, 1779.</p>

<p class='c015'>The flag of the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>
is an interesting relic of the period. It
was originally sixteen feet long. It has
twelve white stars, and four red and
four white stripes. During the battle
between the <i>Richard</i> and the <i>Serapis</i>
this flag was worn by Jones’ ship, and it
was saved by Jones when he and his
crew left his sinking vessel for the
<i>Serapis</i>—<span class='sc'>Washington Star.</span></p>

<p class='c015'>The four divisions of this work comprise,
respectively, first, a series of six tables giving
in brief the principal facts relating to Jonathan
Towle and his five children; second,
a historical narrative, beginning with the
O’Toole family in Ireland; third, the genealogy
proper; fourth, a part consisting
almost wholly of the portraits of descendants
of Huldah (Towle) Chase, and Daniel
and James Towle, followed by a copious
index. The family history involves customs
and personages of colonial life in New
England more or less worthy of record, and
such as a novelist could well utilize. The
book is printed and bound in good style, and
is well illustrated.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most noticeable feature of this genealogy
is the abundance of biographical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>matter, in which are embodied the “Historical
Notes” mentioned on the title-page.
The twelve years’ labor of the author has
produced such a mass of information respecting
the Demings that, in order not to
make too large a volume, the female lines
are indicated simply by the record of marriage,
with no attempt at tracing them
further. The coat-of-arms of the Cole type
used as frontispiece, the author himself disclaims
as being authentic, and will hardly
be regarded by the heraldic connoisseur as
wholly in keeping with the other beautiful
half-tone embellishments. The book is
thoroughly indexed, and printed and bound
in superior style.</p>

Sterling, Ill. 8vo. pp. 379. Ill.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is stated in the preface that, though
many circumstances render it probable, yet
the connection between the German William
and the English John Anthony has not been
established as certain. John was the grandson
of Dr. Francis Anthony, the celebrated
physician and chemist, whose “potable gold”
was proclaimed by him as a cure for all
diseases. Another famous person connected
with the Anthony family was Gilbert Stuart,
the artist, of whom a biography of considerable
length is furnished. Biographical
sketches, indeed, are frequent, one of Susan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>B. Anthony being particularly noticeable.
Appended to the genealogy are extracts
from the Vital Records of Rhode Island relating
to the Anthonys, followed by a chapter
on the Nova Scotia branch. The illustrations
are chiefly portraits, among them, however,
being a coat-of-arms in color. There
is a good index, and typographically the
volume is fine.</p>

Square 8vo. pp. 370. Ill.</p>

<p class='c015'>Robert Molyneux, known as the “Comte
de Meulin,” is the ancestor whose descendants
are recorded in this volume. “The
Lineage of the English Branch,” “Lineage
of the Irish Branch,” “Molyneux of the
West Indies,” “Staffordshire and Sussex
Branches,” and “Unclassified”—these sections
together with one entitled simply “Molyneux,”
form the principal divisions of the
work. The last-named chapter contains the
Molyneux of America. The name is associated
with aristocracy, and persons and
places of high degree are frequently described.
The list of authorities preceding
the genealogy shows a large proportion of
works on the peerage of Great Britain. The
genealogy possesses, therefore, much historical
interest, the narrative portion of the work
equalling in extent that of the vital statistics.
The appendix is a specimen of the
literary talent of a Molyneux, entitled
“Gleanings After a Harvest of Twenty
Years in Roman Fields.” The index is full,
the print beautifully clear, and the margins
wide.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the three parts of this work the first

the record of whose marriage in the Dutch

Church and family records, old papers,
tombstones, public documents and historical

<p class='c015'>Judge Goodpasture was born on Buffalo
Creek, near Hilham, Tennessee, in 1824. His
extensive law practice and his State Senatorship,
though receiving a due share of the
biography, are subordinate in interest to what
proved to be the principal enterprise of his
career, the importation of jacks. The description
of his travels in Europe when in
search of the animals he had determined to
introduce into Tennessee occupies a large
portion of the book, and is very interesting
reading. The James Goodpasture whose
genealogy forms the appendix, was one of
the pioneers of Abingdon Settlement, Virginia,
whence he emigrated to Tennessee.
Though not written for the public, this
memoir of an unusually busy man will give
pleasure to all who like to trace a career of
deserved success.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plan of this genealogy being original
and very peculiar, we will quote the author’s
own description of it: “As far as known
to the author no work has ever been published
following the plan of this work....
Beginning with the ancestral head of Part
I., he is called the trunk. The trunk divides
into limbs, the limbs into branches, they into
twigs. The twigs bear buds which bring
forth blossoms, and the blossoms grow into
fruit. So the seven parts of the tree answer
to the seven generations of Part I.” While
it gives what one must call a bizarre appearance
to the page to head its columns of
names “twigs,” “buds,” “blossoms,” “fruit,”
it may be that such an arrangement, when
understood, is as simple as any commonly
used. Mr. Nance claims that it has advantages
over others. Be that as it may, the
genealogy is an excellent one, very abundant
in biographical facts, forming thereby a detailed
history of the family, profusely illustrated,
well printed, and handsomely and
substantially bound.</p>

having been added relating to Deacon

an heraldic painting on an oaken panel, called
“The Wodhull Achievement,” and now in
